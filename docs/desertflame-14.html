<body><p>She yelled out as air whistled around her. Falling. Sh was falling through the air too fast, her wings wouldn’t come. Felix tried to scream but the sound was lost in the vacuous space.</p> <p>Down. She fell far down the depths of the dark pit until she hit the firm stone ground . . . hard.</p> <p>Pain seared through her nerve endings screaming out. At least two bones were broken and many things were bleeding. She could only whimper seeing as her jaw had cracked on impact.</p> <p>Felix’s breathing was haggard and the iron tang of blood filled her mouth threatening to block her throat. Her lungs wheezed and pain again flushed through her, something had punctured it making it almost impossible to breathe let alone the fact that multiple ribs were now broken or fractured. It felt as if someone had crushed her body under a mountain and continually crushed her into a pulp. She was bleeding internally. If she didn’t find a healer soon her body would heal itself incorrectly. She winced as she felt even the earliest beginnings of her skin struggling to mend itself back together.</p> <p>The thought of each of her limbs healed backward and at odd angles made Felix once again want to retch. Somewhere a venomous voice whispered she’d deserve that fate after what she’d done to them.</p> <p>She cursed so many times she was reasonably sure she was making up new phrases now. Her thoughts repeated in the endless refrain of beating in time with the thumping beat of her heart. Cool slickness dripped from her back, down from her nose and lip, and from her temple. The gash on her back had reopened tearing away all of Anollen’s efforts.</p> <p>“Great just great”</p> <p>She would be doomed with her injuries if she had been human. She would have been dead immediately and at that point, Felix was envious of Mortal fragility. Death would have at least doused the pain ricocheting everywhere in her body. Her body lay broken. She wasn’t going anywhere.</p> <p>“The damn stairs”</p> <p>Felix tried to move, to shift but wherever her mind called her limbs to move agony was the only wailing reply.</p> <p>“Damn it” she all but gurgled. Tears spilled from her eyes and fear shook her core quivering at the thought of being forgotten and broken in the dark depths. She was going to be stuck here. She was going to die. Hell if she wasn’t found and then executed for treason she was going to die from the shitty cracked stairs. She was never see her father again. Never get to feel the new autumn air crackle against her skin as she flew. Never get to hear the sing of swords in the training fields again. And she’d never get to dance before the eternal flame at the solstice again.</p> <p>Grief for her loses threatened to overtake her. Hedion, gods what would happen to him? What would he think? Would he believe that she’d truly committed treason? Or would he continue searching for her? She’d never get to see him again, she’d never get to explain.</p> <p>More tears fell and Felix wanted nothing more than to shut her eyes and for it all to be done. Panic eroded its way into her mind and she was suddenly falling again swirling in hopelessness. Her lungs were filling with blood and her breaths became gurgled wheezes.</p> <p>“Please”</p> <p>Her voice was no more than a whisper when a wisp of air puffed near her. Rubble shifted and it sounded almost like the crunch of pounding feet. She opened her eyes but they wouldn’t adjust to the darkness. She listened but all sound stopped. The fear that held her tightened its grip. She must have been hallucinating the injuries were clouding her head. There wasn’t anyone there only her.</p> <p>An odd warm gust hit Felix again only this time it seemed to be closer. Unconscious shivers overtook Felix and her spine although broken still tingled at the wind and then she felt it.</p> <p>Magic. . . ancient magic like none she’d ever known. Archaic tongues that hadn’t been spoken for centuries whispered in her ears. Whatever or wherever the magic came from it was something elemental something older than the stone she was encased in. Cool creeping and slithering spells and enchantments meant to bind whatever was in the cavern covered her. For a second it was like she could see in the darkness. Swirling colors of old script and texts were all around her.</p> <p>The deepest purple and blues clashed against other symbols bright orange that danced like the very flames Felix honed in her blood.</p> <p>Hope and trepidation filled her as she stared in wonder. Her pain for a moment forgotten. It felt like the world had opened and swallowed her into a time forgotten. Then after a second blink, the colors were gone and she was once again doused in the cold darkness.</p> <p>“W-what. I-is there anyone there?”</p> <p>Her voice quaked and sputtered, blood spilled from her lips. If she could think past her next words and the gruesome pain from moving her mouth at all, she would’ve been embarrassed at the bloody pathetic sight she must’ve been. Why did she have to fall? Hadn’t the Light forsaken her enough? A cruel laugh at her predicament bubbled up her throat. She had asked for help she had let her weakness show and this is what she got in return. Her hysterical laughter shook her body erupting more and more anguish with each vicious jerk.</p> <p>“Hush Faerie”</p> <p>She froze. A deep command rolled over her and her stiffened muscles seemed to relax as if suddenly ordered by invisible puppet strings. Whatever it was it was powerful, more than her and more than anything else she had ever met. Power wasn’t the word to even describe whatever it was. It was beyond that of mortals or even that of her own kind. Whatever it was it held the very feel of something pure. And in one terrifying revelation, Felix realized that the warm wind that periodically hit her wasn’t wind. It was the exhale of breath.</p> <p>“W-what are you?”</p> <p>It was silent for a long time and suddenly the ground shifted and the warm breath came closer almost to scorching heat. It was coming closer.</p> <p>“Child I am something long before your time. Something Ancient”</p> <p>Felix in her shattered form would never admit out loud but, she was very very afraid.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-13.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-15.html">next</a></p>
