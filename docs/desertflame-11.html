<body><h2 id="chapter-v">Chapter V</h2> <p><em>Felix</em></p> <p>Silence swallowed the room whole. Winterians. . . War. Goose bumps lifted Felix’s skin, like the slave girl’s frost and cold air biting into her, War.</p> <p>It had been centuries since the courts had been summoned to the neutral grounds. Aaphire was almost that of myth, the summons of each High Court. Limeare help them.</p> <p>Her father was the first to react to the news, and his face gathered into an unreadable expression. Gone was her father, the benevolent High Lord the Court knew, instead, the War Lord, the general who lead the western front. The Sword of the North and General at Vaelan took his place. The young man who and lead rebels out of the Winterian’s autumn camp and the second under Gabrielle himself.</p> <p>“Elryan, send for the legions in the west and south and pull them forward we need to get the camps set up along the border . . . we need to get everything ready.”</p> <p>Felix’s whole body froze. Wild energy and chaos engulfed and roared in Felix’s ears. She suddenly went silent. Like everything around her kept moving, and she was the only thing stationary.</p> <p>“Give me command.”</p> <p>The demand was quieter than her usual shout, but still, it seemed to echo in the room, and it caused everyone else in the room to freeze as well. In her own ears, she thought she’d whispered it. This was what she was meant for, what she’d trained for.</p> <p>“Honestly Felix this is hardly the time-”</p> <p>Her mother’s whine broke through the silence, but everyone seemed to ignore it. Her father’s face twisted in protest and frustration as her mother continued to squawk her disapproval.</p> <p>“Give me command!”</p> <p>Rough and guttural, the need to take control swept through her body. She looked into Lord Thiradin’s calculating eyes. Pleading that he would actually see reason. That his new hardened shell would not fall prey to his overprotective and prejudiced nature.</p> <p>“I am the best commander we have.”</p> <p>She had to correct herself from saying only.</p> <p>“If the Winterians have decided to let themselves be known, I am the best one to Cut. Them. Down. I will do what you did before.”</p> <p>Behind her, Elryan scoffed indignantly at her sharp remark. She was a female forced to beg at the foot of males. She had to ask for permission and she hated it with everything in her. Elryan’s eyes narrowed at Felix as if seeing her for the first time and suddenly getting a sour taste in his mouth.</p> <p>“Elryan mobilize the men now.”</p> <p>Felix snarled at her father. The messenger that she previously crouched by jolted away. This was her home and her command. She’d earned her place, and she was going to defend it! Seething thoughts boiled in her mind endlessly as her rage began to rise.</p> <p>“No! I will fight, you will not take away my right-”</p> <p>“You are my Daughter, you have the rights I say, and you will listen and follow as I tell you to. This is War Felix, I will not risk losing the sole heir to this Court.”</p> <p>His Bastard, Through he didn’t say it, the word branded over her skin. Nothing but a mistake heir. The whirlwind of crashing emotions hit hard, his denial, his condescending dismissal, and lastly, the degrading title, Felix was after all only his bastard daughter. A female and not even a legitimate one worth genuine concern, his sole option that’s why he cared.</p> <p>“Let them see who you are; show them what right you have,” The serpentine voice slithered through her.</p> <p>There was no thought, just roar, the drumming heat in her blood. Intense fire spread and tickled over her spine, down her arms, and she could feel the flames lick every curve crevice like a Lovers touch as it drowned her entirely. Her eyes no longer saw, there was only the red.</p> <p>The muscles in her back expanded, reptilian scaled skin slid from her flesh, and slowly her feet lifted from the ground. Her magnificent wings. Black and shimmering as if each scale was that of the most brilliant obsidian. Her wings were that of night and true essence of the flame.</p> <p>Felix’s leathers could do nothing to hold in any of her wrath. Blistering heat scorched the room. Whatever beauty the room held, melted away or charred from her growing heat.</p> <p>“You hold more power than all of them, they deny you your right. Show Them.”</p> <p>Fire commanded her body. It wasn’t her in power to control; it was the reverse.</p> <p>“The cursed! She’s . . . she’s a Dragon Scale.” Elryan’s voice cracked and his face paled, as he pointed at her wings, shaking. He was afraid. Good. They all should be afraid.</p> <p>Her mother was choking on her breath, stuck gawking. All of them could feel her heat. Redness branded their faces. Like standing too close to the sun, they each got burned. Fear coated the room, an invisible fog that clung to their skin. Felix could feel it coming off each of them. Even the Lord of Autumn. Her Highlord. They would see now, they would all see who and what she was. Her father had known, had tried to hide it, keeping her far from the palace, well now he locked her inside it, and he would see the consequences.</p> <p>“Monster. You will burn us all.”</p> <p>Though he tried to appear fierce the young Commander’s voice had toned itself too high, and his unceasing shaking spoke volumes. He was terrified. If she were in control, Felix would’ve been satisfied with watching Elryan soil himself at her feet, but no, she needed him to have a more permanent mark. So he would always remember exactly who it was that brought him to his knees. Let them see who has control, show them all see</p> <p>“Kneel”</p> <p><a href="desertflame-10.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-12.html">next</a></p>
