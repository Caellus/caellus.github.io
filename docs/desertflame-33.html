<body><h2 id="chapter-xiii">Chapter XIII</h2> <p><em>Thallan</em></p> <p>Why was it that Thallan could never manage a normal quiet day?</p> <p>Thallan thought bitterly as he ducked low and dodged the flailing swipe of the Rabpion’s claws.</p> <p>The weird demon-like creature had been sequestered into the mountainside and slowly divesting the local farming village of its livestock and even occasionally threatened his people’s young. Not that it’d ever really get the chance Thallan smirked imagining any Faerie mother protecting her child and unleashing all the fierceness that only a Fae mother could.</p> <p>Even still, Thallan could not stand to have the creature threatening his lands any longer. With his lieutenants busy babysitting their new occupant in the manor, he took it upon himself to deal with the ugly thing.</p> <p>Thallan’s shoulders groaned as he slid fast out of the way of another flailing claw, and the creature let out a bellowing screech.</p> <p>“Rotting pile of pig’s flesh,”</p> <p>Thallan cursed as he sidestepped and jabbed with his blade. As glutton demons incorrectly possessing some poor wild hog’s body, Rabpions posed little threat, so why was this one giving him trouble? As boys, Thallan and Kaerynn would hunt them for sport or more accurately for a solution to their boredom.They were literally child’s play, and yet the beast before him just wouldn’t go down.</p> <p>Gritting his teeth, Thallan ducked yet another swipe and lunged feeling his feline instincts kick in as his blade plunged deeper into the beast’s center, and finally, he felt it shudder as it’s blackish syrup-thick life’s blood splattered onto the ice below them. Thallan felt some of the oily mixture hit his cheek, and immediately he had to hold back a gag.</p> <p>Shuddering in disgust, the High Lord of Winter began to turn his back from the slowly melting pool of blackness when he heard a faint gurgling noise, and before he could fully whip around, he felt a deep, sudden heaviness fill the air.</p> <p>Burning scents of death and decay filled his nostrils. His eyes widened as the broken Rabpion’s frame began to crack back into shape, hissing violet magic pulsed faintly around its form, and Thallan immediately recoiled.</p> <p>It was as if the magic had torched his insides, touched is very own magic, and whatever it was, it was dark. It was hungry.</p> <p>Frost flooded into his veins as he felt his magic pull to be free. Thallan’s arms shuddered under the new weight he couldn’t let go. He couldn’t lose control. Not here, not so close to his people. He would not risk them.</p> <p>Thallan’s magic whirled around him and he felt his control begin to buckle. No no no, he could not lose focus. Thallan forced his eyes closed, as his inner strength fought against his natural born magic. It was getting worse.</p> <p>Before, Thallan would face perhaps one lapse in control every couple years, never two so close to one another.</p> <p>Nothing had changed that would cause such a rush. . . just as the thought brushed his mind Thallan was reminded of the flash of emerald. That was new.</p> <p>Thallan’s fists clenched. Felix, nothing had changed until her.</p> <p>Somehow, in some way the Autumnarian was causing this. Thallan grit his teeth picturing the Faerie he had fought the night prior, he would find out what she had done and he would make her reverse whatever thrall seemed to be tearing at his magic. Thallan drew his muscles to pull taut as he fought to gain back control over his magic; the Rapbion long forgotten. With a final shudder Thallan fell to his knees and released a roar from deep in his chest.</p> <p>Power unleashed emptied out into the mountain beneath him. His magic shuddered into rock and ice, a pulse deep below rumbled with him. The Earth shook and suddenly on the mountain behind him there was a deafening crash as Thallan’s avalanche fell collapsing more than half the mountain side.</p> <p>Ice pulsed in the air, the High Lord’s pure, clear magic charged the wind and air so that even the snow itself seemed to vibrate.</p> <p>Silencing his thoughts he mastered his breathing. With each inhale slowing bringing his magic back into his lungs, rapping once again his reins of control around the frigid heart of his power. In and Out. Breathe. In and Out.</p> <p>There was no sound, not even the deep mountain dwellers dared move as the High Lord’s chest shook, inhale . . . exhale. Fore it was best for all, if the beast did not come out.</p> <p>It was almost dusk by the time Thallan lumbered down from the mountain peak. He could feel every questioning stare as he quickly maneuvered through the main court market square, the warmth of hearth and all the people inside clung to his icy skin.</p> <p>Everyone in the village closest had felt the avalanche and those farther away who knew what to look for would have sensed the shift by now. It was getting worse and he knew it.They all did.</p> <p>Hackles raised Thallan continued forward barely making eye contact with any he passed whilst also trying not to be too rude. Thallan, shot further towards his target and approached the Winterian Court capital, Paeitale home to the shimmering White Palace.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-32.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-34.html">next</a></p>
