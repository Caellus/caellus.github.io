<body><p>She tried to focus and make out the things from in the pitch blackness but her eyes could not place where it was, the only sign was where the beast breathed. Every primal message her body sent was the wish to escape torun to not disturb whatever hidden evil creature lay beneath her Father’s home. It was cursed and it belonged in the depths of darkness where she definitely did not.</p> <p>She needed to run she needed out.</p> <p>“Why are you here? What do you want?”</p> <p>The question seemed to pause in the room and Felix could not help but hold her breath. Unease spread through her body, at any moment the beast could do whatever it liked to her, she could do nothing she was helpless. Even with the beast’s scorching breathes the cold damp cavern was slowly soaking frigid coolness into her bones.</p> <p>She began to shake and quiver from the crisp air and almost debated huddling closer to the warm creature beside her. She quickly dismissed the thought, better to freeze from what she knew then find warmth from some unknown creature. She despised the helplessness she felt under its mercy.</p> <p>The damned thing was from Hellae it was there to bring her down to death while she was helpless.</p> <p>“What do I want? Something that was mine and taken from me. As to why I am here, you can thank your father for that.”</p> <p>Hostility was threaded through the creature’s words. Her father had told her once about the darker beasts that ruled his lands. How there once was a time where the elementals held unlimited magic they ruled the world in chaos and brutality. Flame, Ice, Air, Water, Light, and Dark all ran rampant.</p> <p>The time run by the beasts of old . . . but they were extinct. His valiant men and the courts extinguished the remaining terrors in the purges of old. How could this monstrosity still exist? Why would her father lie?</p> <p>“All the beasts of ancient were gone, wiped away. My Father saw to it himself.”</p> <p>“Your father lies. He is a murderer! He enslaves those that are a threat to him. He savagely butchers for entertainment and condones the known imprisonment of innocence and the slaughter of thousands. The beasts, my kind were wiped away long ago, I am the last true ancient of my kind because of his actions!”</p> <p>Anger now heightened Felix’s senses. The urge to defend her father climber up her throat but he lips remained clamped shut. The creature’s heat increased and she found herself beginning to drip sweat from her brow. The intensity was overwhelming and if she could move now was the point when she would have run. Stupid stairs.</p> <p>Damn the stairs, the dinner, the commander, her mother, her father’s command. Damn the Winterian who got her in this mess to begin with. The damn injury. She would repay him a visit when she escaped.</p> <p>If she escaped she would eradicate the Winterians she would show them the war they craved. That promise hummed in her veins. She would stop their bloodshed before they slaughtered her people like they had centuries before. But first, she needed to get out of the pit and away from this Hellae nightmare.</p> <p>“I- I am not my father you have no quarrel with me nor I to you.”</p> <p>Felix tried to keep her voice clear, spitting out the blood gushing with every word she spoke. Her tone was shaky, but she held the same aggression and fearless strain as if she were standing upright facing the thing with a sharp blade held in her hand.</p> <p>“Your father must pay for his actions. I have no quarrel with you, but make no mistake i am something you should fear. I am no friend to you.”</p> <p>Felix prickled at the beast’s words. Even with all his wrong doings, the threat the monster made to her father was not something she would let pass. Very slowly, Felix began to move. Her hands scrapped on the hard rubble. Her wrist was tender, but she clenched her teeth, ignoring the white flash of pain, threatening to pull her to blackness. Breath gasped from her lungs as she pushed her body to move. Her spine curved at an unhealthy angle caused her to hunch forward, but her legs unbelievably held strong.</p> <p>Spots blackened her vision, and her weight rocked forward and back like a swing each time to pull her too close to the ground. Blood loss devastated her body, and shivers of fear and cold shook through her. Even in her state, her eyes never averted from the barely discernible silhouette of the beast.</p> <p>Defiance and anger strengthened any resolve she had left. Her green eyes seemed to almost glow in a fiery orange hue in the darkness.</p> <p>“I am not afraid of you. I am neither your enemy nor ally. But make no mistake I will not be threatened by a monster who hides in the dark.”</p> <p>Her innate recklessness and hunger for a fight echoed in her voice. Felix Elean Sevael stood tall as she felt the beast’s breath bask her face she but didn’t flinch. Courage and adrenaline pulled away from her panic, and her shallow breaths suddenly deepened. She was done. Done with it all. The hum in her blood told her she would fight, and she would die, and that was precisely what she wanted.</p> <p>Despite all her depleted magic Felix even let herself smirk. So utterly convinced she had nothing left to lose. A low growl rumbled, and rocks went flying in all directions. Felix let out a scream as a large weight pounced into her chest, and she fell back onto the harsh ground. A wheeze left her mouth as all air left her lungs on impact. Her bones screamed, and a distinct crack echoed through the chamber. Waves of further agony and fear showered through every part of her body.</p> <p>For Hell’s sake she was tired of falling. Several sharp stabs pierced into her. Claws.</p> <p>It was going to kill her. Her heart was caught half of her begged for death. For it all to finally be over. And yet tears threatened to fall from Felix’s eyes. The other half of her let go of all her bravado. She didn’t want to die. She couldn’t die here. Not alone, not in the dark with all the hatred and burnt bridges between those she loved. But, most of all, she was terrified. Even with the pain, she wanted to live. She trembled, and a whimper she tried to suppress burst from her lips. Regret. Cold, sobering grief fell and weighed down her stomach. She had hurt others. She had been so incredibly stupid she even taunted the beast what an idiot. Anollen had warned her. They all had, but she wouldn’t listen.</p> <p>“Make it fast.”</p> <p>She gritted out the words that felt like ash on her tongue. She didn’t want death, but she’d take it over this miserable world. A cold hard bellow of laughter shook her from her thoughts. The beast was . . . laughing?</p> <p><a href="desertflame-14.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-16.html">next</a></p>
