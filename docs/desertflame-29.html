<body><h2 id="chapter-xii">Chapter XII</h2> <p><em>Felix</em></p> <p>“Sparky, wake up!”</p> <p>A low groan pushed through Felix’s lips as she struggled to lift her leaden eyelids. Why is it that now every time she wished to wake up, it felt as if someone was using her forehead as a smithing anvil.</p> <p>Despite her best efforts minutes past before, light made it into Felix’s eyes. The briefest glimpse of her dreams from her deep slumber still held her and Felix could swear for just a moment she was freezing, like still in a dream Felix tried to orient herself and all she could remember was the smallest glance of silver.</p> <p>“Sparky, Wake Up!”</p> <p>The call pulled at her and for the second time, darkness received from her vision only to be met with a familiar annoying violet gaze. Felix groaned this time, not in pain but more disbelief.</p> <p>“Why iss it I allways wake up to you?”</p> <p>Her sentence slurred as all of her senses began to wake and remember how to function. It felt as if someone had thrust a sandpaper-cotton cocktail down her throat, and her ears still seemed to feel muffled.</p> <p>Violet eyes shook her head a small smile lifting her features before she looked again at Felix this tie frustratedly scowling</p> <p>“Now, Sparky, How could you not tell me you had a Frost Burn?”</p> <p>She gestured wildly about her, eyes wide incredulously. Felix shrugged. It’s not like she deliberately had gone out of her way to not tell the female. She had assumed that her captors had known about the injury. After all, they’d healed all of her broken limbs, jaw, and ribs upon her crossing the border.</p> <p>“Whoever sewed you up back on your side was an idiot, by the way. Sure their stitches were nice and pretty, but they closed the wound; they let the magic stay rooted beneath your skin.”</p> <p>Violet eyes kept going on for a couple minutes about the minute details of properly healing, but Felix drowned out the rest of her rant choosing instead to take the opportunity to search her surrounding.</p> <p>Low and behold, she was not bound to a chair this time but loosely attached to the frame of a bed. Silken lilac cuffs held her wrists and held enough slack that she could turn and move however she pleased in sleep, but soon as she began to rise and move closer to her visitor, the girl let out a low whistle, and the bonds tightened hardening like nothing Felix had ever seen.</p> <p>“Until you’ve proven that you won’t attack me or whoever comes to visit your sorry ass, those bonds will remain. Given specific commands, they can loosen or tighten. When the time comes, and you feel nature’s urge to relieve yourself, a servant will escort you. In case it wasn’t clear, they too will have the commands.”</p> <p>Felix bristled as more of her recollection came back to her, the market, Silver Eyes, her fight, the bitter taste of his cold magic still remained on her tongue. Cheating bastard she should’ve known he’d never keep to his word. Now she had become a well-kept pet.</p> <p>Felix tested her tightened bonds. They felt soft, and yet, when she tugged, they were as unforgiving as her sword’s steel.</p> <p>“So, what am I supposed to do now? Sit here tied to a bed for you and your master’s entertainment?”</p> <p>Violet eyes raised a brow, but took a moment to answer.</p> <p>“Well, sparky, first, you’re going to heal. Then once you’re all fixed up and shown you can behave,” she gave Felix a long stare.</p> <p>“The queen and my ‘master’ will decide what to do with you.”</p> <p>Sensing that was all of an answer, she was going to get any time soon Felix huffed and fell back upon the bed. The mattress was exceptionally fluid around her body, the cool fabrics felt almost as if she were swimming. The bed itself also appeared to be massive. At least large enough for three decent sized warriors to lie together comfortably. Absentmindedly Felix began to wonder whose bed she was laying in. Were the bonds soley for her? Or had they been used before her arrival? Why exactly they’d need such space for so many . . . occupants. Abruptly Felix shook her head, dismissing the idea, her face growing crimson.</p> <p>As she continued to peruse her surrounding it hit her; his scent was everywhere, and even the darker masculine well-kept décor reminded her of her brief encounter against the High Faerie. If he was another guard or a member of the Court, Felix didn’t know but she knew without a doubt, Silver Eyes lived here; she was in his domain. The room itself was not lavish or particularly ornate but still beautiful in its simplistic nature.</p> <p>Sturdy dark wood and spruce lined the walls, deep windows were at the side of one room facing a seemingly endless incline towards a snowy mountain peak. Despite the gaping windows somehow the room still held its welcoming heat.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-28.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-30.html">next</a></p>
