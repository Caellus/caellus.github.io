<body><h2 id="chapter-xv">Chapter XV</h2> <p><em>Thallan</em></p> <p>Thallan’s chest seized as all the pressure in the room vaulted. His Queen.</p> <p>Felix had threatened his queen. Everything in the male screamed at him to intervene, to put the Autumnarian down. Yet even as every hair on his body stood and small incisions of claws sprouted at his knuckles, Thallan felt the invisible ties of his Queen’s magic holding him at bay.</p> <p>“Easy, Aeilre is fine. Back down now”</p> <p>The soothing tone of Kaerynn’s voice hummed in Thallan’s ear as his body slowly responded. Thallan’s steely gaze met Felix’s, even immobile she remained haughty, hatred blaring at the surface and yet he could sense her awe too. Whether she wanted to admit it or not, the Autumnarian could sense there was no farce, Aeilre held within her veins the true power of the Monarch.</p> <p>The Rising Queen of Winter held equal right to the throne of the courts and Limeare willing Thallan would see her put there.</p> <p>Taking a slow breath out, the Winterian Queen began to release her hold over the room and their captive. Even without the magic’s thrall Felix remained motionless, stunned no doubt. Thallan had expected the female to launch as soon as she was once again able but instead he watched as she scanned each of them, assessing.</p> <p>Felix’s bonds had once again tightened making any shift beyond the bed next to impossible, but Thallan didn’t believe for a second that that was what had kept the spritely female still, no even with all her rage, she took command and understood it would do no good.</p> <p>“Well then, that will be enough of that. While I understand your adversity towards me I will not have you threaten me in my own domain”</p> <p>Aeilre’s voice thrummed strong and regal, a tone she so rarely chose over her gentle lilt but all in the room could not help but to listen.</p> <p>Felix’s spine snapped to attention even as her teeth ground hard enough Thallan almost thought he heard them. As the tension continued to dissipate he could barely keep himself from smiling as Felix dipped back onto the bed reminiscent of a punished child.</p> <p>“Thallan,”</p> <p>His eyes met Aeilre’s and at her expression he knew it an instant whatever she was going to say next, he would not like.</p> <p>“You found this Autumnarian at our borders, have fought and assessed her ability, so I’ve heard. Therefore I leave her in your care. She will overshadow your lieutenants in their duties and should she wish, train… you will allow her to expell some of that pent up energy”</p> <p>Mother bleeding light he hated being right. As if baring his same sentiment an indignant cry left Felix’s lips. At least someone else too would have to deal with his Queen’s stubborn nature, there would be no changing her mind now that it had set.</p> <p>“Well just like that friends it looks like we’ve been demoted down to babysitters”</p> <p>Daen’s chuckle woke the others from their shocked stupor. Catalyia rolled her eyes and Ithira grimaced, and Kaerynn ever the settled stone merely met Thallan’s gaze probing his silent question.</p> <p>“Are you alright?”</p> <p>Thallan bit back a small growl in response. No by the Mother no he was not. The Autumnarian had brought nothing but chaos to his Court and his delightful Queen had just called for the more the merrier.</p> <p>“It won’t be that bad” Ryn’s voice continued,</p> <p>Yes yes it would. Thallan shook his head, turning away from Ryn he instead watched Aeilre, waiting until she gave a small nod and moved to stalk back down the hall. While ediquitte may have demanded he stay and attend to his Queen, anger pulsed beneath his fingers, she was safe, she’d proven as much, so he was not needed and he was too angry to meet her gaze.</p> <p>Silently the High lord of Winter left his lieutenants to watch over Felix.</p> <hr /> <p><em>Felix</em></p> <p>Mother of Light it was fucking cold. Wind swept her auburn hair into her numb face as she glared at the grinning devil dragging her behind him. And as no surprise to anyone, Daen offered to take the first shift with Felix unwillingly tagging along.</p> <p>Their path ladened with snow and ice was marked by large uneven boulders as they approached the base of a mountain. Gods they better not have to climb that.</p> <p>Felix’s gut squelched in warning and her feet cried out from the already bitter-chilled torment. Daen it seemed was in no such dismay has he whistled holding onto Felix’s silken bonds.</p> <p>Although her bindings had loosened to remain comfortable and albeit warm considering the bleak frosty wind, Felix wanted them off.</p> <p>Somewhere along their journey the grey-soup sky had broken out into a flurry of small flaked snow and Felix peaked out her tongue to brush one of the falling dusts. The sweet cold tinged along her nerves and although she shivered she had to stop herself from doing it again. It was odd, not altogether unpleasant though. When she caught Daen watching and smirking at her Felix quickly righted herself and puckered her mouth tightly even as her cheeks warmed.</p> <p>”No need for that, I’d venture a guess it’s your first snow? None of that harsh hale you get on your side of the border”</p> <p>Daen lifted an eyebrow at Felix satisfjed when she gave a small shy nod in response.</p> <p>”The first snow is something to celebrate, no one here will blame you for looking”</p> <p>Shrugging Daen poked out a blossom-colored tongue and let one of the dainty white flecks float into his mouth. The male was strange, strong and he could have been intimidating if he wished and yet, he seemed currently more like a small child. He was trying to lessen her discomfort. Odd.</p> <p>Odd. That was the best word to describe this whole place Felix determined. Back home Felix remembered plenty of tales surrounding the miserable frozen court. As far as she could tell, only small escence of what her people believed reflected what she had to witness, course that could simply be what they chose to show her.</p> <p>Felix narrowed her eyes at her swaggering babysitter. There wasn’t a way she was going to get past him, enoguh observation combined with her lack of magic told her as much, but for now she could just bide her time. Felix often was one to much prefer up front tactics and fighting, swiftness behind the scenes she left more so to her Courts spies, but for now she could do her best to emulate what her Father had told her when it came to waiting.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-36.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-38.html">next</a></p>
