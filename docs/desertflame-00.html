<body><p>1</p> <p>BEGINNING MYTHS Long before the rise of man and a world that we would recognize there was a story. The story told of our earliest beginnings, of a world linked to ours throughout history. Ancestors to those we know and love, our gods, saints, heroes and villains, all descendants from the world that came before. . . The world of TEHLAEYA In the beginning, there was Darkness, black and endless. No light, no sound. There was nothing. Then out of the nothingness, a single spark. Different cultures argue why the flash came to be, but, all agree, this spark was the start. The start of Limeare. The Mother Light herself. The Light that started it all. She spread and spread pushing against the Darkness. Her brilliance marked the very beginning of time; the very essence of life began with her. As Light emerged, she wished to no longer be alone and breathed life into her children. Light bore four sons, four kings who together combined their power and created Tehlaeya, the world where everything lives. The four sons who eventually became known as our seasons, Winter the firstborn, then Spring, Summer, and at last Autumn. Light, then had four daughters, who created the two suns and two moons that surround Tehlaeya. They each brought brightness and heat that melted away the cold, and the Dark. Together the eight siblings’ seasons and moons and suns changed the sky, bringing balance, the dawn and the dusk, versatility between each season brought</p> <p>2</p> <p>beauty unlike anything seen before. Plants grew, and life sprouted blossoming beneath the heavens above. Light loved her children and was delighted at their creation, but everything was still too quiet. Mother Light and her children yearned for other’s company to enjoy their creation, so the Goddess created birds to fill the skies, fish to fill the seas and animals to cover the land. Beauty spread over Tehlaeya. But, it still wasn’t enough, so, at last, Light bore a child unlike her others, she created the Dragon. Great beasts of the most elemental of magics, they were the Kings and Queens, Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, and Dark. Mischief, Beauty, Envy, Love and Chaos. They reigned over all for a time. The Dragons flourished, maintaining balance and ruled over Limeare’s creation. At least that was how it all began until the Light had her final few children that changed everything…</p> <p>3</p> <p>First came the Faerie, like their descendants before them, there were eight. Four males. And Four Females. They were beautiful wild creatures who carried the blessings from the seasons and elements. They had magic and souls. They served and worshiped beneath the great beasts, the suns, and moons. At first, they too maintained balance. But they were different than Limeare’s previous children, they created and invented, they loved one another, there’s was that of passion and pleasure. Yet as they grew, Darkness too bloomed, Jealous of Light’s beauty in all her creations, Darkness sought to corrupt her newest heirs. So the Faerie were born the first children of both Light and Dark. Agency to choose, to be swayed. Where there was love, there was hate. Where Darkness would also flourish, Light could be born. It was then the Goddess of Light and Darkness became one deity instead of two. Light had bonded with her mate. They together became the two-faced God. The parent of the Faerie. Not one complete but a mix of two. Forever the push and pull. And then their last descendants arrived The final creation and the worst of all . . . Man. Man was even more corruptible than the Faerie of before them, more conflicted, more dynamic, more emotional, and explosive, but most of all, more mortal, frail creatures who could die from time. A disgrace. And in their shame, quickly turned to Darkness. Although her eldest sons and daughters called for Man’s destruction, Light and Dark did not destroy their newest children.</p> <p>4</p> <p>Light gave them a small final mercy to protect them from her other half and all her other children. Limeare banished Man to a different realm where they would not have to feel the shame of their mortality, where they could grow apart, and this how our world of man and the world of the Tehlaeya broke apart. But this is not that story.</p> <p>5</p> <p>PROLOGUE Esperanza The bristling cold bit down into her very core she thought with a grimace Esperanza was not meant to be cold, her warm Summerian blood was meant for the light and heat of the twin suns. Her bright caramel brown eyes narrowed and glared at the stormy grey sky looming above her head. Eight years, it had been eight years since the sun was covered in the grey. Eight years since the Winterian kings sieged all over the world. Eight years since they murdered the Summerian Monarch and usurped High Lady of Spring, slaughtered the Autumn High Lord. And it had been eight years since Winter decreed its dominion over all of Tehlaeya. And after eight years, she was tired of being cold. Esperanza Eliean looked at the grey sky and then looked back to the rolling snow-covered hills in front of her. Hundreds of Faerie and creatures of magic all stood at attention lined together as far as the eye could see. All there for one reason. Esperanza gazed over Valaen, the last border between Winter, Autumn, and Spring, filled to the brim with men and women ready to lay down their lives. Hundreds of Thousands of gathered all in the hopes that they could once again be free. Across the barren cold earth, their enemies stood firm.
