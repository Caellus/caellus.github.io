<body><p>as she lifted her eyes to the sky. What was it now? There wasn’t possibly a way her father could have heard news about the hunting party this quickly. . . she shook her head, well she’d have to find out. She gave a withering look to Hedion as he grinned at her smugly as if I told you so. Felix turned FireFly not before she felt her second reach for her grasping her elbow. She looked up staring into his amber gaze, the last rays of sun light shown on his concerned face as he spoke, “I know what you’re thinking, but Felix… just Don’t do anything rash. Please.” Felix stared at him a second longer, searching his pleading gaze before 22</p> <p>wordlessly nodding. Allowing a slow breath to pass through her lips Felix arched her neck preparing for the journey ahead. Even with her mount’s swiftness on the wind the journey would be at least a day. Turing away from the clean stalls Felix clicked Firefly forward. Soon the scent of smelting iron receded from Felix’s nostrils and was replaced first with fresh dew and golden fleck grasslands of her Court’s center and then the cool sea breeze, towards the palace . . . towards her father’s domain.</p> <p>23</p> <p>Chapter III The Palace’s large shadow loomed over Felix, even with the relief upon her journey’s end the shadow hung daunting. Tiredness ached in her weary bones. Sparks spread through her veins in fluid anticipation, visits with her parents were . . . always a battleground. Though her father had summoned her, she was sure her mother had something to do with it. The last time Felix went head-on with the Head Mistress of Autumn, she may or may not have blown apart the eastern wing of the palace they were staying in. Her mother always seemed to be there to pick and prod at her life. Determined to try and tame her. Which never went over well. The Autumn palace sat atop a large Cliffside overseeing the lands waterside border. Salty winds carried whispers from the far seas, and the light wind pricked at Felix’s skin, and she could feel her collapsed wings twitch. The itch to fly was intense, but the burning ache of the wound reminded her she was grounded. A light scowl marred her features as she drew nearer to her Father’s bejeweled fortress. The glittery house was always too shiny and showy. It never provided adequate protection, not really. Its high walls were hollowed out as to accommodate the precious stones pressed into them. The exterior defenses were outdated, and it’s inner courtyard lay practically open and waiting. The inner keep walls were more substantial; however, Felix knew that if any enemy forces reached the internal walls, it would already be too late for her beloved Court. Felix passed through the gates and ignored the oncoming stares from the guards and nobility. Some whispered behind her, and her shoulders tensed. This was why she stayed far far away from the palace; always pointless whispers and 24</p> <p>burning stares. Though Felix rarely came nor stayed in her Father’s domain, she’d memorized her way into the throne room ages before. This wasn’t her first summoning, nor would it be her last. The throne rooms large lacquered copper pained doors hung open showcasing the grandeur of the Autumn High Court. Across the vast hall Felix could see, sat Lady Aquin Sevael of Autumn, silently watching intently as her Court shifted bellow her throne. Her long ivory braid twisted ornately down her back. Everything about her was feminine in grace. A long indigo-midnight gown flowed from her, rippling like a stream. The fabric clung to her body’s curves as if painted there, and occasionally bits would twinkle and shift in the courts dappled torchlight. The High Lady of Autumn was renowned for her beauty, her intelligent, bright cobalt eyes, and her cunning to protect her Court and her Mate. And then there was her mate. Beside LadyAquin, sat the male in charge . . . her father. High Lord of Autumn. Sword of the North himself, Thiradin Haine Sevael. His broad shoulders and high stature appeared larger than life atop his throne. He was a living blaze, heat and power seeped from him, pulsing throughout the room, begging to be challenged. Even though his age climbed well beyond the centuries, the High Lord of Autumn matched his mate, his features proclaiming beauty power and strength. Like Felix, he had hearth red hair and golden flecked green eyes. His strong square jawline accentuated his stoic rugged features. Felix looked him over, and her eyes met his. Lord Thiradin Sevael watched as Felix entered the throne room. His eyes studied his daughter watching her unabashed entry. Felix’s gaze remained forward her head high and</p> <p>25</p> <p>chest thrust forward. She would not allow this hall nor these uptight morons to prick her apart, hungry vultures the lot of them. Instead Felix’s stare shifted between her Lord and Lady, awaiting their reactions. Unease tickled down her spine even as she remained relaxed and straight. Both High Lord and Lady acknowledged her entry and Felix let herself release a breath. She knew deep in her heart she would always come between them for, as beautiful as Lady Aquin was, and though she held all the love in Thiradin’s heart, she remained a barren beauty and had yet to bear offspring. Thus, Felix was the sole continuing bloodline and heir for the High Lord if still only a Bastard. Thiradin sat silently gazing down and marking her, her stance, her leathers and uniform, noting the earth and soil crusted onto her from the wood and travel yet said nothing. The High Lord wasn’t a cruel man, but the his twinge of hostility he carried was one of his defining traits, that is, except for when viewing his mate or daughter. Even while he could never truly embrace her due to her impure royal blood, Thiradin never treated her differently than he would a pure-bred child. She was his daughter, his to protect and his that he would one day mold to lead his Court. Felix bent at a low bow to the thrones and pressed her palm to her heart, letting two fingers rest upon her collar bone. Respect and pride beating in her chest, saluting her father. She neither looked or bothered to acknowledge the woman sitting to the left of the High Lord just bellow the thrones. Her mother’s black hair resembled that of oily raven’s feathers in the sunlight, and her pale complexion showed she never stepped a foot outside her luxury and jeweled palace.
