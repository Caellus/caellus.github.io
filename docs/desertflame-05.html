She gave a withering look to Hedion as he grinned at her smugly as if to say I told you so.</p> <p>Felix turned FireFly not before she felt her second reach for her grasping her elbow. She looked up staring into his amber gaze, the last rays of sun light shown on his concerned face as he spoke,</p> <p>“I know what you’re thinking, but Felix… just Don’t do anything rash.
