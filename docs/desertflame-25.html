He hung back shifting his weight dodging two strikes before she was able to make a decisive blow to his left cheek. He blocked her and he forced her reel back. She stiffened, believing he would push forward, but instead, he waited for her; he was toying with her. The molten-moonlight in his irises flickered with promise in the torchlight. He moved with feline grace, circling her, every ounce, a Predator. And for the first time in a long time, perhaps in all her life, Felix felt like prey. They each continued their steps in their dance when around them began to holler with impatience. Realizing she wasn’t going to foolishly attack this time the male took the initiative and thrust forward, he sent a kick towards her ribs, and she barely dodged in time. And while she was still reeling he landed another catching her stomach and then face. The taste or blood trickled against her tongue as she bit her cheek. Felix backed up a step, and the male advanced. He was light on his feet, and he didn’t pull his punches. Despite the infuriating smirk lining his celestial features, he didn’t shy away because she was female. He didn’t falter, and he held no qualms about fighting her. Begrudgingly she respected him for it. Not many males she came across dared to fight hand the hand against a girl. Hedion had been a rare bout of luck. He’d never been reserved about being her sparring 104</p> <p>partner. Goddess how she missed him. He kept her calm while others only made her feel like she was drowning. Her eyes swept her opponent, he was nothing like her second in command. Hard and angular, where her lieutenant was almost boyish and radiated in the sun. The Winterian glimmered like his Court’s beloved frost. Her thoughts swamped her and sensing her idleness, her dance partner shot out another kick catching her footing. The world flipped, and hard wood met her wounded back. She bit her lip from crying out. She felt cool wetness slip down her back and knew the wound had reopened. “Dammit,” she cursed under her breath. The male moved quickly to pin her, putting a leg on her sternum. His eyes stared down to meet hers, triumph radiating until Felix twisted shoving off his foot, forcing him off. She was on her feet within seconds, inhaling sharply as her torn skin screamed at the movement. Her vision spotted in the corners, and she wanted to curse in frustration the damn wound would be the death of her. Before the male fully got the chance to recover his loss of balance, she attacked. Without a smidge of remorse. As he tried to once again invade her space Felix aimed for the one eternal weak spot for her male counterparts. Her knee struck between his legs hard, and a short grunt left his lips. Now at least they’d both be in pain. He shot out a fist meant to catch her in the jaw, and she ducked below, aiming for his ribs. The wind rushed out of his lungs in quick procession as her fists hit him hard. She continued her onslaught until he caught her wrists. For a panicked minute, she feared he’d break them his grip harder than any she’d ever felt. 105</p> <p>They were like vices of steel. She struggled furiously, but he was unrelenting. His warm breath coated her face, and his scent hit her hard great pine and cold crisp air and ice assaulted her senses. It was so alien to her, and she could tell from the male’s features he thought the same about her. Heat blistered to her face. Too close, he was too close. She fidgeted, but he held her wrists above her head. She kicked him in the shins and watched his teeth grit, but still, he didn’t release her. She threw her head back, and before he could anticipate her forehead cracked against his skull. Gods and Mother Light that hurt. White-hot pain flashed before her eyes. But she succeeded in releasing his grip as he growled clearly dazed. “Fine, you want to play like that. We’ll play.” He rushed her, landing a few solid blows causing Felix’s world shake. He held nothing back and quickly forced her to the edge of the stage but his outstretched reach for her was her opening. She grasped his arm, and with as much strength as she could muster, she flipped him over her shoulder. Silence fell around the room. The crowd around them stood wide-eyed. She sent another blow kicking at his annoyingly pretty face and heard his nose crack. He grunted, but before she could withdraw it, he grasped her leg and pulled it to him. And so once again, they both were on the floor this time to his advantage. Without hesitation, he pounced, flipping them and forcing all his weight upon her. With her arms outstretched above her head in one of his massive fists and her legs held down by his sheer weight and muscle of his thighs. Felix was stuck.</p> <p>106</p> <p>The blood spreading along her back pooled beneath her as her wound split further, and this time she couldn’t keep her cry quite as quiet. She was thankful their audience couldn’t hear it, but he did. Above her, his eyes narrowed as he breathed heavily, and even as his own nose dripped blood down his face, his nostrils flared slightly. “You’re hurt.” His words seemed more to himself than to her, but even as she struggled, he didn’t let go. The male leaned closer to see her more clearly, his already healing nose brushed along her jaw and heat crept up Felix’s face along with mortification as she was certain she heard men in the crowd catcall and laugh. “Get Off Me” Felix whispered the words, hissing, but the male-only searched her face and eyes as if trying to ascertain what damage had been done. “You need to stop fighting. You’re hurt. Enough of this” He rasped curtly back at her, gritting his teeth as something dark flashed in his eyes. Felix ignored him, still shifting her weight, trying to throw him off to no avail. Her back continued to bleed as she pushed against him until something sharp and bitter flooded all of her senses. Cold raw magic crawled along her skin, and suddenly her hands were stuck. Her entire body was frozen, forced into submission as she couldn’t move a muscle.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-24.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-26.html">next</a></p>
