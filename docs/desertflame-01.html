<body><h2 id="chapter-i">Chapter I</h2> <p>Present</p> <p><em>Felix</em></p> <p>Felix twitched as the needle slipped through her skin, slowly mending the bloodied flesh that sliced through her shoulder blades. The leather between her teeth strained slightly at the force of her bite but kept her howls muffled.</p> <p>Above her, a healer continued his onslaught. A particularly colorful variety of curses ran through Felix’s mind as the needle made another pass. Slowly the skin was pulled tightly enough to close her cut, and she hissed as the pain shot daggers through her angry, bleeding flesh. Three nurses already restrained the raging faerie as her muscles grew taught on instinct. Regardless that in the long run, it might help her. Felix squirmed and hissed doing all she could to escape the vicious needle’s bite.</p> <p>The ancient, decrepit healer above, ticked his tongue in irritation and may have let the needle pass a little harder through Felix’s skin than needed. Of course, the healer’s entire existence was to prevent and help injury and pain, that said, currently he was losing patience for young woman’s antsy behavior and had to resist the temptation to make a wrong stitch through muscle tissue. The healer’s tent had been full of Felix’s groans for the last few hours, and soon, the chime for dinner would arise, and finally, the torture would be postponed. She would soon be free of the haggard hands and the cruel needle. Felix’s fire-flecked green eyes stared out the tent flap opening and looked onward to the Autumn speckled valley.</p> <p>The fresh leaves had fallen just a few weeks after the solstice. They were earlier than usual. Felix rolled her eyes, knowing the village Elders would mutter on how all sorts of bad omens follow the season’s early arrival. She only ever shrugged off their concerns. She was a spirit meant for the hot season; her sparking eyes and auburn hair proclaimed it so.</p> <p>”It’s a miracle this wound hasn’t infected your lifeblood yet. Whatever hare-brained idea possessed you to hide this injury from me, thank the Light that your Mother caught you. Otherwise, it could have permanently damaged your back and possibly your wings.”</p> <p>The healer scoffed, “Foolishness. Whatever gave you the thought of engaging the Winter Border Guard almost got you killed.”</p> <p>Felix rolled her eyes silently mouthing off at the old man’s reprimand. The healer in response pulled the final stitch unnecessarily tight causing yet another curse.</p> <p>Felix had been Fine. So she had managed to scrape herself in her last encounter with the border guard. Damn the frozen bastards.</p> <p>”It was a flesh wound; it would’ve been fine; I don’t understand your fuss. A minor inconvenience.”</p> <p>Felix never found the art of healing all that impressive. Sure it sometimes was necessary and for some of her men, miraculous, even still so often it seemed so overkill. Even though Felix was often injured, she usually decided it wasn’t worth whining about. She was hard-skinned enough to handle the pain and blood. A soldier should always be able to handle themselves. What was the point if she couldn’t stomach a few scrapes and bruises. Still, the healer, in this case . . . wasn’t entirely wrong.</p> <p>The Winterian had landed a deep wound she’d admit that much. The bastard had gotten lucky. Perhaps it could’ve impaired her ability for a couple centuries and of course her dear Mother couldn’t have that. A “disabled child” as she put it. So with no other alternative, Felix was restrained in the gods-damned healer’s lair.</p> <p>Her muscles ached from lying face down for hours, and her blood hummed with the need to return the favor to the popsicles who had made her bleed. Liquid crimson oozed down from the stitched flesh. Her tunic had been cut away, and the frayed edges were now doused in red. The harsh tang of iron and puss invaded her nostrils, and Felix had to quench a gag. Anollen likely wouldn’t appreciate having to clean her vomit as well as her bloodied mess. The long hours had dragged forward as each cut was dressed heavily in a salve and bandaged. Felix was incredibly tired of staring at the brown leather table. She had memorized each crest and valley in the tough worn leather. The mundane brown being her only view. Finally Anollen ceased his pulling and pressing and released a satisfied if not disgruntled sigh.</p> <p>”Do not stretch your wings for another fortnight and keep the wounds dressed and-”</p> <p>Not bothering to heed his words before cutting him off Felix snapped,</p> <p>”Thanks for the lasting ache in my back and the string now attached to my skin, but alas I must go. I’m sure to see mummy dearest soon and report to her your good work. Anollen, as always it remains a pleasure.”</p> <p>Felix simrked with a mocked bow. She winked at the flushed old man and sent the nurses a sly smile as she waltzed out the tent. Her back still stung, but it was bearable. She eyed the soldiers lining the tent edges and lifted her chin high. She was not in need of protecting nor healing, no matter what her mother or anyone else for that matter, thought.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-00.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-02.html">next</a></p>
