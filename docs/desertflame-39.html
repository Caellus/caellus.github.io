<body><h2 id="chapter-xvi">Chapter XVI</h2> <p><em>Felix</em></p> <p>The mountainous buildings Felix approached were every bit the tight utilitarian fortress her home Palace was not.</p> <p>Large heavy stone walls upheld the mountain’s stone overhang and even from her far position below Felix could see the readied crosbow ledges and small viewing slits high above.</p> <p>More great doors opened for Daen allowing Felix to spot the inside of perhaps one of the more beautiful training grounds she had ever seen. Felix’s eyes widened taking in the open cleared space.</p> <p>Unlike the brutal cold exterior within the fortress some form of magic kept the air fresh and dry, not oppressively warm but comfortable enough that Felix no longer felt the need to shiver.</p> <p>Large rock stairways lead to higher landings above where Felix spotted many staring down and watchinf their arrival. Ahead of them, soldiers marked only by their light armor paused in their drills and salutted to Daen.</p> <p>A barracks, Daen had taken her to the barracks. And for once since her entire ordeal had started, Felix felt perhaps the tiniest bit at home.</p> <p>Soldiers clammoured forward many grinning and clapping Daen on the shoulder before sobbering their expressions when their eyes spotted her behind him. It seemed neither her fire-bright hair nor silken bonds went unnoticed.</p> <p>Whispers swathed around them before Daen tugged Felix forward. Shocking her, Daen did not annouce her prescence nor explained it to the surounding troops, instead he merely continued forward until they came to another inner set of doors leading to what could only be the soldiers chambers. Felix noted in almost envy the pristine care in which the weapons hung up to the barrack walls were kept. Not that her home wasn’t known for its milartaristic prowess, it was but Felix could at least begrudgingly admit that next to her own encampment she had rarely seen such care and precision.</p> <p>Soldiers combed through the surrounding halls and passageways some in full battle gear, others in cotton shirts and loose pants and some in noticably less to the point where Felix had to avert her gaze. The males here were not shy.</p> <p>Daen spared no time to give Felix a thorough tour or bothered to explain exactly where they were or what they were supposed to be doing so Felix was left to her obsevations.</p> <p>Along with the seemingly endless bunch of Winterian males Felix noted more than a few Females fully engrossed in their own combat drills or other assignments. Felix was immediately reminded of Catalyia and her warrior built form.</p> <p>Perhaps this is where she had trained. It explained for once why none of the surrouding group had taken much stock of her beyond her Autumnarian status. Her sex wasn’t what brought a question. It was refreshing and Felix even let herself smile lightly.</p> <p>”Ah finally not such a sour face, I knew I’d grow on you. The others can think what they will but I knew once you had the chance to spill some blood I’d have you smiling, like you belong.”</p> <p>Daen’s remark surprised Felix and she turned to eye him wearily.</p> <p>”I don’t belong here Winterian I am a prisoner, you brought me here”</p> <p>Daen shrugged in response looking not at all concearned at her remark.</p> <p>”Whatever you say Sparky, but like is drawn to like. You are a warrior plain as day. You are meant to be around other warriors”.</p> <p>Felix was silent for a long while after that.</p> <hr /> <p><em>Thallan</em></p> <p>The shift had been easier this time. drawn out of his own volition Thallan was pleased to be back in his most true form. His paws suck deep into the freshly lade snow and his silver cat eyes scoped out before him.</p> <p>He had set out not long after Daen had left with Felix, and while he did not mention to his lieutenant that he would be following along, he got the sense after a good few hours of the journey that Daen had sensed his presence.</p> <p>Thallan watched as the Autumnarian took in the cold landscape and smiled silently to himself at her awe when she caught sight of the glider. He didn’t trust Felix, although he knew firsthand of how capable Daen could be, he had known the same to be true of Catalyia and needed to be certain. Or at least that’s what he told himself as he lumbered closer.</p> <p>Once the pair came to the barrack enterance Thallan had begun to trun to leave when something in him pulled him closer. He should go, he had other responsibilities, plenty of them and yet he found himself wanting to watch the Autumnarian. If for no other reason than perhaps he could gage and find out why exactly the hellion was affecting his shifts.</p> <p>Allowing his spotted tail to twitch behind him Thallan climbed up he moutainside, forgoing the path the two had taken on foot and instead he found his normal outcroping of stone just above the barracks training field.</p> <p>He’d just watch for a litte while he ammended to himself. Make sure Daen wasn’t in need of assistance and see what exactly the little Autumnarian could do.</p> <p>After a good quarter of an hour Daen and Felix lagging behind him appeared from the barracks inner walls and walked out to the center of the training field.</p> <p>As a curtesy to Felix, Daen cleared the field reassigning drills so they could have some semblance of privacy, Thallan’s chest bloomed in pride at his lieutenant’s forethought. No matter that she was his opponent, having to train for the first time before dozens of unfamiliar soldiers would have been an unneeded cruelty.</p> <p>Not that Thallan believed Felix had one shy bone in her small form, she certainly hadn’t been daunted the night she went toe to toe against him.</p> <p>Daen and Felix settled in the center of a wide ring of white glassy stones set into the earth. Magic field. Daen could choose whether or not he wished to enagage it, either dampening any magic present or in some way altering their surroundings, for now though he seemed satisfied just circling her. Felix to her credit watched carefully and Thallan watched seeing the gears in her mind process what was going to happen. Although he was just far enough above them not to make out all that was said he knew the gyst of it. Thallan had discussed plans with Daen the night before and understood what he was going to do.</p> <p>Daen was going to be fine, between the magic field, his own ability and if at all else, the dozens of legions within the barrack walls, there was no way Felix would escape and yet Thallan couldn’t bring himself to leave. Rather as the two began a back and forth and Daen moved to release Felix’s leash, Thallan found himself slinking closer until he was barely above the snow, allowing just his eyes to peak through.</p> <p>From where he was situated he was barely visible even to the keenest of scouts. Yet even with his camofladge and fur shifting to match that of the surrounding frost, Thallan could almost swear Felix looked at him.</p> <hr /> <p><em>Felix</em></p> <p>They were being watched.</p> <p>She could feel it. At first it had been faint, but now she was sure of it. Someone or something was watching her. Felix’s mind raced alert. She gazed over the surrounding training field, but saw nothing beyond her grinning infuriating babysitter.</p> <p>Daen slowly circled Felix within the ring of pale stone they’d entered and Felix did her best to ignore the prickling she felt along her neck and instead focus on the matter at hand. But as her eyes made one final sweep over the mountain looming by them she caught just smallest fleck of silver.</p> <p>Crouched and surrounded by snow she saw them. Silver eyes, encompassed in the purest blue flame. They were back again. Felix twisted to stare at Daen but her overseerer it seemed found nothing amiss, could he not see them? Or Light and Mother was she seeing things?</p> <p>Felix shuddered and Daen took it as a sign she was cold, a signal to start moving. Felix ignored the pressing silver irises, choosing instead to believe they weren’t there. She again faced Daen waiting for his next move. Daen had released Felix’s lilac leash which to her amazement and horror managed to sliter back and somehoe disappear into her remaining silken handcuffs.</p> <p>”Now Sparky-”</p> <p>Felix bit into her cheek at the nickname, but allowed Daen to continue.</p> <p>”Here’s the deal. I am going to release your little bonds on the condition of mutual understanding that you are going to remain inside this field, better yet this circle for now.” He paused to make sure she understood.</p> <p>”I’m sure you could find some way to finegal past me, but I hope you’ve come to realize that there really is nowhere for you to go. If you somehow managed to get past the many dozens of legions behind me, there is nothing but boudnless snow and ice for miles.”</p> <p>”You will be caught, of that have no doubt.”</p> <p>Felix wished she could protest find something in her to disprove the Winterian’s words, but they rang true. If she even managed someway out of the fortress she’d more than likely freeze before she found some path back to her freedom. So with no other remaining option the heir of the Autumnarian Court glared at her captor and proceeded to sulk as he finally took off her bonds.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-38.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-40.html">next</a></p>
