<body><p>The hit came quickly, and I had to lunge out of the way as his fist grazed the side of my ribs. Still holding my stance, I struck out my foot to try and swipe his Peter’s from under him, but he dodged before I could make contact. My eyes met his grey ones as he threw other punch towards my right. I ducked out of the way and feigned left, leaving my right side vulnerable and hoping he’d take the bait. Sweat began to drip from my temples as I twisted my body to avoid his oncoming blow and instead, knocking my own fists into his own exposed side. A quiet grunt left Peter’s lips, and his eyes seemed to narrow. In any other circumstance, I would’ve smiled. The Other pairs were in their own sparing assignments around us, each of them quipping back and forth with the occasional laugh. Sparring was ordinary, and yet I could still tell they were watching us from the corners of their vision or rather watching him. And who wouldn’t? The stranger moved like liquid water, fast and fluid, with each blow.</p> <p>News had spread quickly that a new transfer had taken Ben’s place. When we had finished our extra mile, a few in my unit had tried to pull me aside to question about the stranger, but we were rushed to our next Drill before I got the chance to explain.</p> <p>My thoughts shook back just in time to see Peter’s kick aimed straight for my chest. Before I could react and dodge, the ground suddenly hit my back hard, and I was staring up into grey eyes. Around us, the boys in other pairs seemed to pause. Peter, unlike me, took the opportunity to let his lips lift in almost a smile. Heat thrummed up into my ears roaring, and for the second time, I twisted and grabbed hold of the foot he’d so kindly left on my chest, and with one sharp tug, I wrenched him to the ground. The air flew out of his chest, and while I could’ve taken advantage, I decided better to stay down. The match ended in a draw with both our backs covered in mat’s chalk. Without a word, I stood and watched the others keeping back to my prone partner and trying to keep a familiar face from my mind of who my partner used to be.</p> <p>After all the matches ended, we were sent to the canteen for a rest and mid-day meal. Usually, we were given free rein to sit with whomever we chose, but, for some reason, the Sergeants mandated we sit with our room block. So for the third time today, I was now stuck next to the tall stranger, and he seemed about as pleased about it as I was. The other boys at our table were pleasant enough. Ben had always been more social with them than I had. He could fascinate them with stories of whatever new idea he was working on. And now, especially, his absence was plain as day, and they wouldn’t really meet my eye, so we all sat silently. Two tables away, I looked up and saw Alex wave. Alex and his twin Jude had been my unit mates and close friends since our Initiate year. Alex gave me a concerned glance as he glanced over at Peter. I had to resist the urge to nod and roll my eyes. Alex and Jude had also been close to Ben, and my guess is they would be less impressed by my new roommate. Jude noticed our silent exchange and gave me a sympathetic shake of his head. My teeth bit into the side of my cheek, but I still managed to smile. I didn’t really care for sympathy, but I knew he meant well. Honestly, all I wanted was to leave the canteen and head to the training rooms. My fists ached from sparring, but I would’ve happily spent a few more hours hitting a bag.</p> <p>“Who are the two you keep waving to over there?”</p> <p>A relatively deep voice with a strange European lilt spoke next to my ear, and I had to hide my shock. He speaks. Peter’s words were short and concise, and he looked over to Alex and Jude.</p> <p>“Those two are my unit mates; they’ve been a part team since initiate year, the lighter blond one is Alexander, and the slightly more dirty blond is his twin Jude.”</p> <p>Peter looked one last time at the twins before returning back to his food. He didn’t acknowledge me as I stared at him; I was left wonder what he was thinking about.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes of silence later, the meal break ended, and we were given solo training, and finally, we were released to be on our own. A weight lifted slightly from my shoulders as I left everyone else to head to my room back in the barracks or cadet block as the overseer’s called it. The hallway felt too long as I passed the seventeen rooms before I reached my own. Luckily most people had headed to the more public training centers for the company. With luck, I wouldn’t have to face anyone. The door slid open after I placed my finger on the pad, and the familiar ding sounded.</p> <p>“Good evening, Cadet; Lance.”</p> <p>Francis’s voice sang its standard greeting. Traitor, I thought to myself as I remembered the automation reporting me this morning. My eyes glanced over to the bunks. My muscles whined, begging for a reprieve, but instead, I turned towards the blank wall to our cell.</p> <p>“Francis open the private training room, sparring ring, bag, lifting equipment,”</p> <p>I recited off the list in my head of my usual gear choice. Ben used to request the swimming simulator, which always clashed with my workouts and thus usually ended in a sparring match. My mouth twitched, remembering how he’d grumble whenever I won. There was no argument this time, and the wall panel in front of me simply melted away, and a second room turned into the private training center I had requested.</p> <p>My eyes zeroed in on the bag and the red hanging gloves. Francis would scold me for not using the gloves, but I wanted to feel the bag beneath my knuckles this time. I spun the thick tape between each of my fingers and closed my eyes. A soft breath left my lips as my fists made the first impact.</p> <p>The night air was brisk against my skin as they lowered us down on the line from the airship. The sound of the propellers was deafening. At first, all of us crouched and did our best to cover our screaming eardrums. Then the ship was gone, and we were on our own. Sixteen of us per team, all lined up. Our night gear made it difficult to see one another without the night goggles. I turn around, and Ben’s green-hazel eyes meet mine, he smiles though he motions me forward and I nod. Alex, Jude, Ben, and the others all hurry towards the forest line. Our mission was relatively simple: seek cover, avoid the mines planted in hidden locations on the mission field and retrieve the device; in this case, find the red and black flag. And of course, do it before the other team. Though our masks covered out mouths, the comms kept us in a continuous link.</p> <p>“Chilly Tonight, you’d think the commander would be nice enough to land us somewhere a bit more tropical or at least provide some sort of thermal reprieve. I swear I’ll lose my fingers by the end of this”</p> <p>Ben’s voice carries into my helmet, and I smile even if he can’t see it.</p> <p>“You want to be somewhere warm and humid in all this?”</p> <p>I ask incredulously. Our gear packed half our weight at least. I’ve never been a fan of warm weather I’m better suited for the cold. Ben, by contrast, would take a desert over a stiff breeze any day. I can tell he’s about to come up with some witty remark when Alex calls over</p> <p>“You two gonna keep chatting, or are we actually going to do a mission tonight?”</p> <p>“Yeah yeah, we’re coming”</p> <p>The team was quiet as we reach the tree line. At the head of the line, Jude scans the areas in front as Ben covers the rear. We each keep an eye out for anything unusual, and our scanners run constant checks for mines. It’s generally assumed the mines are not armed, but if you step on one, you fail the mission. In real life, you’d be a goner. Chills rake up my spine as we move further into the silent forest. Wrong. Something feels wrong.</p> <p>Anxiety radiates off our entire team. Jude is about to turn around and call for us to change course when Alex shouts out a warning, but it’s too late, and we all hear the shot fire. Snipers hiding in wait at the tops of the trees. Jude takes a hit in the shoulder and is down in an instant, and then the chaos unfolds. Ben pushes me behind a tree trunk as we do our best to seek cover. From the corner of my eye, I see that three more of our teammates are down. Alex managed to drag his unconscious twin behind a boulder, but we are all pinned down. I turn, and Ben’s eyes meet my own. The shots are knockout, you get hit, you lose. “What should we do? We’re pinned” His thoughts match my own, as we start to rattle off ideas when-</p> <p>“You’re bleeding.”</p> <p>The sharp voice broke me from my thoughts, and suddenly the forest and ringing shots vanish. Ben is gone. The last thing I see is Ben’s hazel gaze staring deep into mine, before the training center blurs to focus. Only then do I feel it, I’m still hitting the bag. Peter was standing just to my left, and his hand reached out to catch the swinging heavy-bag immediately, stopping its momentum. My breaths come out in short heavy bursts, and sweat drenches every inch of me. The whole world seems to take a minute to settle when I finally looked down gritting my teeth at my split and bloody knuckles.</p> <p>“Thanks”</p> <p>I didn’t meet his eyes. I wouldn’t. I expected Peter to leave or at least shrug, but he doesn’t. I could feel he was still staring at me. Un-relinquished anger coiled in my chest twisted and begging to be released.</p> <p>“Why aren’t you training with the others in the center?”</p> <p>“I could ask you the same thing.” His deadpan matched my own, his steel eyes never once leaving me.</p> <p>My words came out sour and harsh, I just wanted him gone. While, his voice wasn’t snide but brutally honest, and the anger again tugged inside me. The sudden urge to hit him and finish the match from that morning tugged. I had to bite my cheek to catch myself. If he was aware of my dwindling restriant, he certainly gave no indication. He just continued to stare. I eventually couldn’t take it anymore.</p> <p>“What! What are you looking at?”</p> <p>He was quiet for a minute, and then in his same neutral, calm tone responded. “I was just thinking, your hands were scabbed this morning; you do this often.” My eyes stayed firmly fixed into the spotless tile floor.</p> <p>“Good observation; the sergeants would be pleased.” My voice was quieter this time, and after having waited a beat for a response, then I turned my back and headed straight for the showers.</p> <p>I waited a full twelve minutes before I heard his footsteps finally recede. I released a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding, and I tap the controls once and the freezing water pelts into my skin.</p> <p>By the time I make it out of the shower, the natural light outside is dark, and Francis leaves the reminder, it is time for our evening meal. Before heading to the canteen, I dragged my feet to the still open training center. But my feet froze in place when I see the heavy bag which before had smears of blood from my knuckles was now clean.</p> <p>“Francis?”</p> <p>The automated voice dings in response, “Yes, Cadet Gerrard? How may I be of assistance?”</p> <p>“Did you clean and reset the training center?”</p> <p>“No, Peter the new assignment did that shortly before exiting”</p> <p>While part of me stood there still confused, the other parts of me battle back and forth, one part wishing to throttle my new room assignment and question why he cannot merely leave me be, and the other pull for me to find the bastard and thank him regardless. I end up doing neither and instead shut off the lights and walk towards the echoing activity of evening meal.</p> <p>The canteen is filled to the brim, and this time the seating arrangement is not assigned open. As soon as I entered, I could see Alex and Jude call me over, but my eyes scan over the rows of tables until I see at the only empty table sits a tall chestnut-brunette with grey eyes that at the moment were downcast into a book. Odd, I would’ve thought he’d sit with Granger. I start towards Alex and Jude’s table when my feet halt. My mind flashed back to the training room and the cleaned heavy bag, and reluctantly I turn and walk to the empty table.</p> <p>“Yes?” he arched a brow at my approach, and my glance met his.</p> <p>“You know you do not have to be alone, there’s plenty of room at, frankly, any of the other tables. Even Granger’s”</p> <p>At his prior roommate’s name, his face seemed to grow paler by an infinitesimal amount considering he could have already camouflaged himself in a snowdrift. Without meaning to my eyes slide over towards the center tables, and I spot Granger Belaire’s tall built frame.</p> <p>The Academy’s esteemed head boy is seated with the other top cadets of our year. He sits in the middle of the table and even from the edge of the room it’s like a beacon is around him. Granger is the epitome of ease. He laughs as the boys around him joke and snicker. From this viewpoint, it’s hard to believe he’s the best in our unit. He looks like a simple teenager; mussed hair, slight stubble, his appearance shows nothing of the obedient strait-laced sharpshooter captain we’re told to follow. After having noticed my cursory glance, Peter actually deigns to speak.</p> <p>“Somehow, I’m not entirely sure Granger nor posey of lieutenants would appreciate my company. I’m better off over here.”</p> <p>A slight blush peeks over the corners of his ears, but as soon as it’s there, it vanishes. He stares back toward his mashed potatoes silent once again. I heave a shrug and sit at the seat across from him. And although the clamor of noise around the canteen doesn’t lower, it’s as if every eye has suddenly landed on my back. So much for avoiding other’s attention today.</p> <p>“Well, in that case, do you mind company?”</p> <p>I figured he again wouldn’t answer and continue to stare are the creamy off-white mash on his plate but, he looked up at me, and what I assume to be a grimace on anyone else seems to almost be a smile on his face and not that infuriating smirk.</p> <p>“Company would not be … unpleasant”</p> <p>That might as well have been a shining compliment. After that, both of us quietly resumed eating, and at a snail’s pace. Slowly I felt other’s eyes cease staring. Well good, none of their damn business anyway. I shifted, and for a sec, my eyes again drift to the center tables, and I find Granger Belaire staring directly at me, his smile remains but his eyes wain into something cold, and a chill lifts on my spine. *** The rest of the meal finishes without incident, and no sooner than we’ve all devoured our rations do the curfew warnings radio through the halls. We all slug through the halls heading to our blocks, and neither Peter nor I say much as we head to our newly shared room. We both seem to slow upon the threshold, and around me, I feel people’s subtle looks at my shoulder as they pass, some with curiosity of how my new roommate and I will get along and others with sympathy, pity, and the last few with indifference. The latter is my favorite, while the other on-lookers set my teeth on edge. Rather than continue to give them all something to watch, I pass through the doorway towards the bunks without waiting.</p> <p>The tension was like thick smog coating the walls, coating each breath through my lungs, while there were two bunks, each with two beds. My eyes skip over mine and the empty cot above mine. Each bunk, respectively, was for one cadet. The top was for sleeping while the bottom for gear, but I had always preferred being closer to the ground. One night Ben had decided to take the bed above mine. He never bothered to explain why. It was just that. And after initiate year, he never really had a reason to. It just was. Was, every night even with all his noise, every night until now.</p> <p>Without a word, Peter headed to the unused bunk across from mine and climbed up the latter. The metal groaned slightly, and I already knew it’d be just as bad as Ben’s tossing and turning. For a second, my eyes glanced over to the corner again, looking for the clutter. As if still searching for what my mind screamed was already gone.</p> <p>“-he was quite tidy.”</p> <p>My thoughts whisked away. I turned to Peter, who was again looking at me. Great. “What?”</p> <p>“Your roommate, your past one,” he seemed to pause as if feeling the need to specify. “he was quite tidy, nothing here is out of place, the bed is perfectly made.”</p> <p>Subconsciously it takes my mind time to realize the humorless laugh was slipping past my mouth.</p> <p>“No. No, he was anything but tidy well, not conventionally. He kept his gear all in order and everything else, but his trinkets and project would be everywhere. Ben would make a mess somedays that could cover the floors so bad it was a fire hazard, the bed’s made because it was never unmade, not since the hall service made it almost five years ago.”</p> <p>That was the most I had talked about it, any of it, since the incident. My throat suddenly ached as if only coming to grips with how much I had just relayed, much less to a stranger.</p> <p>Peter didn’t respond, and I didn’t wait for him to. I crawled into my bunk and rolled on my side away from him and shut my eyes. Like with the last two nights, the bed felt empty, and even with the warmed synthetic covers, my body shivered.</p> <p>“Good night Lance,”</p> <p>It was the first time, the first real-time he’d ever said my name, and with my eyes closed tightly, I could only mutter a quiet answer as all I could think was his stiff European lilt was nothing like Ben’s. The night was silent, and when the lights darkened, I opened my eyes, it was about a quarter of an hour until I heard Peter’s breath even out and I continued to listen. Like every other night since, I waited, and sleep never came.</p> <p><a href="topfour-00.html">previous</a> <a href="topfour-02.html">next</a></p>
