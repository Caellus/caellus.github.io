<body><p>what her Father had told her when it came to waiting. patience Felix, there will be time. You just need to find your opening. For now just stay alive and keep watch. Thiradin’s voice while not truly speaking to her provided some comfort as felix continued moving along the haggard icey path ahead. Though she was not pleased she knew patience was the right call. Even if she couldn’t escape immediately, perhpas she could lend a hand to her court in other ways. ”You’re awfully quiet, from all of Catalyia’s stories I was lead to believe</p> <p>156</p> <p>our newest guest was a chatter box, what a shame” Daen’s prodding continued as the two clambered on. Felix ignored his ussage of ”guest” knowing full and well he was trying to get a rise from her. ”I see little to discuss with you” Felix kept her tone bored. Her eyes scanned the surrounding moutains and she looked for any signs of other life, but as far as she could see they’d left all signs of it with the dawn’s light when they departed the Manor. Nothing but snow, rock and ice spread out before Felix and she gritted her teeth as more wind swept around her. They had used tunnles back by the village, why couldn’t they do so here? And for Limeare’s sake where was he taking her? As if sensing her stewing Daen smirked and pulled to a stop. ”Walks in the cold are good for the soul, the wind, the fresh air aorund, and no one but me for you to threaten. Now enough with your quiet grumbling we’re getting close” *** Despite Daen’s promises, ”close” was at least another hours of travel before Felix could see the dimmest speck of civilization huddled into the very mountain side. Felix kept her lips shut as they neared a small outcrop where a path began winding up the steep rockside. How could this possibly be how their people got around? The path was barely wide enough for one, there was no way, travelers or legions or any group beyond single file could traverse through here on foot. In her own Court Felix was remindeded of their wide flattened stone roads that swathed through there 157</p> <p>lands connecting trade and routes through into the Sumerian plains, it seemed there was no such thing here. Perhaps Winterians truly were solitary not require travel for more than just oneRight as the thought passed through her mind a large shadow hung over Daen and Felix. About half a league above them a Winterian hovered clinging to a glimmering metal bar connected to a white-blue sail. The strange contraption swirled above their heads and Felix’s jaw dropped. Wind it seemed propelled the Winterian airborne and ahead towards the large stone buildings. ”Gliders. So, now you’ve learned yet another of our secretive travelling ways” Daen smirked continuing forward and letting Felix pick her jaw back up from the ground and hurry to follow.</p> <p>158</p> <p>Chapter XVI Felix The mountainous buildings Felix approached were every bit the tight utilitarian fortress her home Palace was not. Large heavy stone walls upheld the mountain’s stone overhang and even from her far position below Felix could see the readied crosbow ledges and small viewing slits high above. More great doors opened for Daen allowing Felix to spot the inside of perhaps one of the more beautiful training grounds she had ever to lay eyes on. Felix’s eyes widened taking in the open cleared space. Unlike the brutal cold exterior within the fortress some form of magic kept the air fresh and dry, not oppressively warm but comfortable enough that Felix no longer felt the need to shiver. Large rock stairways lead to higher landings above where Felix spotted many staring down and watchinf their arrival. Ahead of them, soldiers marked only by their light armor paused in their drills and salutted to Daen. A barracks, Daen had taken her to the barracks. And for once since her entire ordeal had started, Felix felt perhaps the tiniest bit at home. Soldiers clammoured forward many grinning and clapping Daen on the shoulder before sobbering their expressions when their eyes spotted her behind him. It seemed neither her fire-bright hair nor silken bonds went unnoticed.</p> <p>159</p> <p>Whispers swathed around them before Daen tugged Felix forward. Shocking her, Daen did not annouce her prescence nor explained it to the srrounding troops, instead he merely continued forward until they came to another inner set of doors leading to what could only be the soldiers chambers. Felix noted in almost envy the pristine care in which the weapons hung up to the barrack walls were kept. Not that her home wasn’t known for its milartaristic prowess, it was but Felix could at least begrudgingly admit that next to her own encampment she had rarely seen such care and precision. Soldiers combed through the surrounding halls and passageways some in full battle gear, others in cotton shirts and loose pants and some in noticably less to the point where Felix had to avert her gaze. The males here were not shy. Daen spared no time to give Felix a thorough tour or bothered to explain exactly where they were or what they were supposed to be doing so Felix was left to her obsevations. Along with the seemingly endless bunch of Winterian males Felix noted more than a few Females fully engrossed in their own combat drills or other assignments. Felix was immediately reminded of Catalyia and her warrior built form. Perhaps this is where she had trained. It explained for once why none of the surrouding group had taken much stock of her beyond her Autumnarian status. Her sex wasn’t what brought a question. It was refreshing and Felix even let herself smile lightly. ”Ah finally not such a sour face, I knew I’d grow on you. The others can think what they will but I knew you’d belong here”</p> <p>160</p> <p><a href="desertflame-37.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-39.html">next</a></p>
