<body><p><em>Patience Felix, there will be time. You just need to find your opening. For now just stay alive and keep watch.</em></p> <p>Thiradin’s voice while not truly speaking to her provided some comfort as Felix continued moving along the haggard icey path ahead.</p> <p>Though she was not pleased she knew patience was the right call. Even if she couldn’t escape immediately, perhpas she could lend a hand to her court in other ways.</p> <p>”You’re awfully quiet, from all of Catalyia’s stories I was lead to believe our newest guest was a chatter box, what a shame”</p> <p>Daen’s prodding continued as the two clambered on. Felix ignored his ussage of ”guest” knowing full and well he was trying to get a rise from her.</p> <p>”I see little to discuss with you”</p> <p>Felix kept her tone bored. Her eyes scanned the surrounding moutains and she looked for any signs of other life, but as far as she could see they’d left all signs of it with the dawn’s light when they departed the Manor.</p> <p>Nothing but snow, rock and ice spread out before Felix and she gritted her teeth as more wind swept around her. They had used tunnles back by the village, why couldn’t they do so here? And for Limeare’s sake where was he taking her?</p> <p>Sensing her stewing Daen smirked and pulled to a stop.</p> <p>”Walks in the cold are good for the soul. The wind, the fresh air aorund, and no one but me for you to threaten. Now enough with your quiet grumbling we’re getting close”</p> <hr /> <p>Despite Daen’s promises, ”close” was at least another hours of travel before Felix could see the dimmest speck of civilization huddled into the very mountain side.</p> <p>Felix kept her lips shut as they neared a small outcrop where a path began winding up the steep rockside.</p> <p>How could this possibly be how their people got around? Sure highborn Faerie bore wings upon birth, but surely there were other who needed to traverse the moutains.</p> <p>The path was barely wide enough for one, there was no way, travelers or legions or any group beyond single file could traverse through here on foot.</p> <p>In her own Court Felix was remindeded of their wide flattened stone roads that swathed through there lands connecting trade and routes through into the Sumerian plains, it seemed there was no such thing here. Perhaps Winterians truly were solitary not require travel for more than just one.</p> <p>Right as the thought passed through her mind a large shadow hung over Daen and Felix.</p> <p>About half a league above them a Winterian hovered clinging to a glimmering metal bar connected to a white-blue sail. The strange contraption swirled above their heads and Felix’s jaw dropped. Wind it seemed propelled the Winterian airborne and ahead towards the large stone buildings.</p> <p>”Gliders. So, now you’ve learned yet another of our secretive travelling ways”</p> <p>Daen smirked continuing forward and letting Felix pick her jaw back up from the ground and hurry to follow.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-37.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-39.html">next</a></p>
