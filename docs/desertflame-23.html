Whatever they planned for her, she promised herself she would not behave. The ‘stalls’ resembled horse stables though she supposed with a small bit of gratefulness that they at least didn’t smell like them. Women were separated from the men by right and left. They tore her right, and she found dozens of women all in differing levels of dress preparing for their debut on stage. When the guard had attempted to link her to one of the stable walls with her bindings, she kicked him harshly in the shins. The man was tall and stocky; he cursed loudly, had she been a more demure maiden she might’ve blushed. Felix used the opportunity and rushed forward, hunching low and pushing the guard off his feet. It may not have bought her freedom, but it felt like fresh heat to her frigid bones to give the man trouble. A slight lick of who she was. She would not be like the other quiet, timid females around her, she would be difficult, and she smiled, watching the disgruntled guard approach once more. It took an additional two men and three further attempts until Felix was firmly secured in her stall. A new bruise colored her cheek, but it did nothing to mar her shit-eating-grin. When they tried to get her to dress appropriately for the</p> <p>96</p> <p>auction, the guards foudn Felix was still in full command of her teeth all of which were quite sharp. After many futile attempts the guards had enough and called back her Winterian escort. “I thought I told you to behave. And what’d you do? Slam into your guards and cost me an extra couple silver for their poor wounded egos. Did you really bite one of them?” Though her tone was frustrated and she stood alert Felix could’ve sworn she saw something almost like approval in the woman’s violet eyes. “What possibly made you think I would acquiesce to your request?” Felix sang out the words in a sickly sweet tone. Her captor rolled her eyes and came forward, holding chains likely meant for her hands and neck. Felix hated irons but at least applauded the women’s choice of adept bindings. The guards, however, had mistakenly chosen to hold her in rope. There was little slack, but she’d twisted enough that her chapped wrists could slide free. Felix poised and ready waited until violet-eyes came close to loosen the ropes and apply the irons. Felix let herself still, even her hearts quick beat she hushed merely waiting to strike. The Winterian, having mistaken her lack of resistance for acceptance, relaxed her guard and didn’t move fast enough to dodge Felix’s lunge soon as she stood a breath apart. Both females grappled in the dirt until Felix held the women pinned beneath her. She pushed a hand atop the girl’s mouth to keep her from calling the guards. Using the irons meant for her wrists, she secured the woman’s hands and</p> <p>97</p> <p>relieved her of a dagger hanging from her hip. “Now, there’s little need or reason for me to kill you, but I won’t hesitate, so don’t try anything.” To her surprise, the female stayed quiet and put up little fight when she hoisted her to her feet. Her captor now only watched her in silence her face that of stone, and Felix couldn’t read any expression or motive coming from her. She used her new captive to shield her body as she stepped out of the stall holding the dagger to the girl’s throat. Women around the gasped and some clambered away in hopes of avoiding the scene. The guards like earlier came forward, but emphasizing with the blade, Felix warned them back. “Don’t make me spill her blood because of stupidity. You could get to me, but not before she goes down.” The guards kept far back but covered the exit to the stalls. They hoped to foil her escape, but she had little hope of escaping anyway. No, she instead walked, Winterian as her block, towards the stage. The men were smart enough this time and didn’t dare come forward as if sensing she was plenty adept with the blade and would make good on her threats. The stage was a raised platform bathed in light facing crowds of men and some women along with a raised dais holding four High Faerie. Three males and a singular female all watched her sitting tall and beneath them hung a banister showing off the white blazing frost leopard crest of the Winterian Court. 98</p> <p>Felix all but froze as she realized soon as she mounted the stage that she would come face to face with her sworn enemy. The High Lord of Winter. A tall blonde came before Felix wearing a scant translucent dress, her bids came quickly and she was led off stage. Felix watched still under shadow until the stage was clear and then made her ascent to face the shocked crowd. It took them all a moment to react, to realize something was off, and the wrong female was in chains. Suddenly all four high-born Faerie in the dais, High Lord somewhere among them stood. The female, with shimmering white hair and a stunning face, bared her teeth while the three males watched in silence but wrath and outrage poured from each of their stances. So her captive not only had station but mattered to the High born bastards. Felix’s mind ticked as she evaluated her next move. And again her smirk lined her face, One of the males spoke first, “Who are you, and what do you want?” Felix had to resist the urge to snort. What would any escaped slave want? “My name Felix. You took me with the intent of selling me; I will not be your chattel, in return for my captive, you will release me. I beat her in a fair fight; I earn the right to demand my freedom.” She had no idea if the words hung true; back home, combat was seen as a way to mark trade when it was necessary, and she only hoped it would hold</p> <p>99</p> <p><a href="desertflame-22.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-24.html">next</a></p>
