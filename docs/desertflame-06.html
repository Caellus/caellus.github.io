<body><p>long before she delved too deeply in nobility Ariade could’ve been called beautiful. Even ethereal in her exotic features and well-blessed silhouette. But now she more than fit in amongst the rest, too opulent, jeweled and bitter. Thiradin always warned Felix to respect her mother, after all. “She birthed her.” Felix could practically hear his grumbling remarks. But it was ridiculous, neither Felix or her mother really cared for one another, not in any amount that counted. Felix was only a power play for her mother, and they both knew it. Because of Felix, Ariade made herself worth more than the purest gold to Thiradin. She gave him an heir when his bride and High Lady mate could not. Ariade had always tried to persuade Felix to remain more ‘Demure’ to be the Lady that was expected. If Felix didn’t act like the heir to the throne, Ariade feared that no one would remember that her child was the only heir. Needless to say there was little love lost between mother and daughter. Resentment rolled off of Felix like the incoming Spring tide. Her mother’s maple-brown eyes seared into the side of her skull, and Felix knew she’d have to face her at some point. There in all her finery, her mother lounged, Ariade Greavyre-Moira the High Lord’s the esteemed Head Mistress of Autumn. Upon catching her gaze, the raven cleared her throat. “Felix dear, I assume you’re done sewing up.” The pinched high tone of her voice grated against Felix’s ears, but she resisted cringing. And she cursed silently. “Respect her. Bow. Show her some respect . . . don’t let her get to you” Her father’s words repeated in her ears, slowly cooling the boiling heat that rose up in her chest. Her eyes narrowed at her mother, and she bit down the 27</p> <p>snarky reply she so desperately wanted to spew. When instead her father drew her attention, demanding, “You were injured?” Her Father raised a brow expectantly at her, his face still a firm mask while his eyes crackled, the spark of anger slowly burning in his irises. At that very moment, under the scrutinizing gazes of her parents, Felix wanted to shrink away. Her father, like her mother, was severe whenever Felix “damaged herself,” although only one of their concerns was actually for her well being. “Wait, that’s why I’m here? It was only a scratch. I got into an argument along the border, a skirmish really. I am Fine.” And ’Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire. Felix watched her father and cursed in her head. She should’ve never mentioned the blasted frozen border. If Thiradin’s eyes were a spark before they were now a wildfire. “The Border? What the Hell were you doing anywhere near those frozen beasts?” “I was doing my rounds and going hunting, the Haize faded for a moment, nothing happened, I beat them to stag, and they challenged me for it, I left my mark, and they left theirs.” Felix’s voice was tight, and she squared her stance. The lie was a small one, but it smoldered on her tongue anyway. This is what she had been trying to avoid. Her mother she could deal with at least, but her father never left any room for words beyond his own. Felix cursed herself again, and she stared right into her father’s disapproving gaze. 28</p> <p>“I’m fine really it doesn’t-” “Show me.” “No, it’s been stitched its f-” “Show me the mark now Felix.” Lord Thiradin stood from his throne, and it was almost as if thunder cracked. He was simmering. His eyes dared her to disobey, rage etched onto his face. Hesitantly Felix reached behind her and raised the trim of her tunic. The soft material eventually etched high above her shoulders and finally over her head so that only the wrap of cloth that held her breasts firmly remained on her upper body, the rest was bare for the Court’s hungry eyes. Felix kept her eyes on the floor as her cheeks warmed. Releasing one final huff she let that fall too, showing the bloody bandages along her shoulder blades. She was not willing to make eye contact with any one of them. Thankfully her hair and hand covered enough but She felt their stares piercing into her. She clenched her teeth. It felt worse than Anollen’s needle threading her flesh. She wasn’t weak; her wound had healed. She was Fine. Around her, she felt her father’s power rise, daring anyone to stare at his half-clad daughter, and suddenly all the stares left, everyone suddenly finding somewhere else to weigh their eyes on. Nevertheless, she could still feel their judgment and clawing interest. The wound that marred her skin had been appalling; it was something to behold. The Winterian guard had landed a strong blow, and if she had been facing the front slightly to the left, the wound would’ve taken her lifeblood. A deep swipe lay between her shoulder blades and the bewitching blue frost hex set a web of blue vines slowly spreading from the slash. “I’ve already seen Anollen, the frost will wear off in a few days, and it 29</p> <p>will only leave a small mark. I’m fine, Father.” His eyes never left her back, as his only offspring Thiradin’s chest tightened. Her injury was unacceptable too much of a risk to all he stood for. But, at the moment, his bloodline and Court mattered little, something primal inside the Lord of Autumn snapped. His stance tensed, and his look became almost feral. Male dominance displayed in every manor. “You will not be going anywhere near the borders again.” Unlike his previous bellowing, his voice was barely a rasp. A warning; danger seeped into his soft whisper. “You will stay behind these walls and where your mother can keep a close watch over you.” Felix’s head, shot upright, and her jaw fell slack. Disbelief and anger bubbled to the surface. Out of everyone in this blasted Court, her father, the general, the Lord of her home, had always stood by her. She was his daughter, his Commander. He had never forced her to be something she wasn’t. He never made her be what her mother wanted, a Lady, more like a pretty gift for some lord’s son to take and put on his mantle nothing of substance. Just an object. Her hands shook, and red seeped to the edges of her vision. “No, you can’t do that! I will not become some pampered pet cooped up in this ridiculous place! My home is out there where it has always been and where it will stay.” A battle of wills shined between their eyes. Her throat tightened, and her vision blurred for a minute. Why was her vision blurring? She would not show weakness here. Her father’s scorn hit something deep inside. She wasn’t the son</p> <p><a href="desertflame-05.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-07.html">next</a></p>
