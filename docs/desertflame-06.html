<body><h2 id="chapter-iii">Chapter III</h2> <p>The Palace’s large shadow loomed over Felix, even with the relief upon her journey’s end the shadow hung daunting. Tiredness ached in her weary bones. Sparks spread through her veins in fluid anticipation, visits with her parents were . . . always a battleground.</p> <p>Though her father had summoned her, she was sure her mother had something to do with it. The last time Felix went head-on with the Head Mistress of Autumn, she may or may not have blown apart the eastern wing of the palace they were staying in. Her mother always seemed to be there to pick and prod at her life. Determined to try and tame her. Which never went over well.</p> <p>The Autumn palace sat atop a large Cliffside overseeing the lands waterside border. Salty winds carried whispers from the far seas, and the light wind pricked at Felix’s skin, and she could feel her collapsed wings twitch. The itch to fly was intense, but the burning ache of the wound reminded her she was grounded.</p> <p>A light scowl marred her features as she drew nearer to her Father’s bejeweled fortress. The glittery house was always too shiny and showy. It never provided adequate protection, not really. Its high walls were hollowed out as to accommodate the precious stones pressed into them. The exterior defenses were outdated, and it’s inner courtyard lay practically open and waiting. The inner keep walls were more substantial; however, Felix knew that if any enemy forces reached the internal walls, it would already be too late for her beloved Court.</p> <p>Felix passed through the gates and ignored the oncoming stares from the guards and nobility. Some whispered behind her, and her shoulders tensed. This was why she stayed far far away from the palace; always pointless whispers and burning stares.</p> <p>Though Felix rarely came nor stayed in her Father’s domain, she’d memorized her way into the throne room ages before. This wasn’t her first summoning, nor would it be her last.</p> <p>The throne rooms large lacquered copper pained doors hung open showcasing the grandeur of the Autumn High Court. Across the vast hall Felix could see, sat Lady Aquin Sevael of Autumn, silently watching intently as her Court shifted bellow her throne. Her long ivory braid twisted ornately down her back.</p> <p>Everything about her was feminine in grace. A long indigo-midnight gown flowed from her, rippling like a stream. The fabric clung to her body’s curves as if painted there, and occasionally bits would twinkle and shift in the courts dappled torchlight.</p> <p>The High Lady of Autumn was renowned for her beauty, her intelligent, bright cobalt eyes, and her cunning to protect her Court and her Mate. And then there was her mate. Beside LadyAquin, sat the male in charge . . . her father.</p> <p>The High Lord of Autumn. Sword of the North himself, Thiradin Haine Sevael. His broad shoulders and high stature appeared larger than life atop his throne. He was a living blaze, heat and power seeped from him, pulsing throughout the room, begging to be challenged.</p> <p>Even though his age climbed well beyond the centuries, the High Lord of Autumn matched his mate, his features proclaiming beauty power and strength. Like Felix, he had hearth red hair and golden flecked green eyes. His strong square jawline accentuated his stoic rugged features. Felix looked him over, and her eyes met his. Lord Thiradin Sevael watched as Felix entered the throne room. His eyes studied his daughter watching her unabashed entry. Felix’s gaze remained forward her head high and chest thrust forward. She would not allow this hall nor these uptight morons to prick her apart, hungry vultures the lot of them.</p> <p>Instead Felix’s stare shifted between her Lord and Lady, awaiting their reactions. Unease tickled down her spine even as she remained relaxed and straight.</p> <p>Both High Lord and Lady acknowledged her entry and Felix let herself release a breath. She knew deep in her heart she would always come between them for, as beautiful as Lady Aquin was, and though she held all the love in Thiradin’s heart, she remained a barren beauty and had yet to bear offspring.</p> <p>Thus, Felix was the sole continuing bloodline and heir for the High Lord if still only a Bastard. Thiradin sat silently gazing down and marking her, her stance, her leathers and uniform, noting the earth and soil crusted onto her from the wood and travel yet said nothing.</p> <p>The High Lord wasn’t a cruel man, but the his twinge of hostility he carried was one of his defining traits, that is, except for when viewing his mate or daughter. Even while he could never truly embrace her due to her impure royal blood, Thiradin never treated her differently than he would a pure-bred child. She was his daughter, his to protect and his that he would one day mold to lead his Court.</p> <p>Felix bent at a low bow to the thrones and pressed her palm to her heart, letting two fingers rest upon her collar bone. Respect and pride beating in her chest, saluting her father.</p> <p>She neither looked or bothered to acknowledge the woman sitting to the left of the High Lord just bellow the thrones. Her mother’s black hair resembled that of oily raven’s feathers in the sunlight, and her pale complexion showed she never stepped a foot outside her luxury and jeweled palace. For a time perhaps long before she delved too deeply in nobility Ariade could’ve been called beautiful. Even ethereal in her exotic features and well-blessed silhouette. But now she more than fit in amongst the rest, too opulent, jeweled and bitter.</p> <p>Thiradin always warned Felix to respect her mother, after all. “She birthed her.”</p> <p>Felix could practically hear his grumbling remarks. But it was ridiculous, neither Felix or her mother really cared for one another, not in any amount that counted. Felix was only a power play for her mother, and they both knew it.</p> <p>Because of Felix, Ariade made herself worth more than the purest gold to Thiradin. She gave him an heir when his bride and High Lady mate could not. Ariade had always tried to persuade Felix to remain more ‘Demure’ to be the Lady that was expected. If Felix didn’t act like the heir to the throne, Ariade feared that no one would remember that her child was the only heir. Needless to say there was little love lost between mother and daughter. Resentment rolled off of Felix like the incoming Spring tide. Her mother’s maple-brown eyes seared into the side of her skull, and Felix knew she’d have to face her at some point.</p> <p>There in all her finery, her mother lounged, Ariade Greavyre-Moira the High Lord’s the esteemed Head Mistress of Autumn. Upon catching her gaze, the raven cleared her throat.</p> <p>“Felix dear, I assume you’re done sewing up.”</p> <p>The pinched high tone of her voice grated against Felix’s ears, but she resisted cringing. And she cursed silently.</p> <p>“Respect her. Bow. Show her some respect . . . don’t let her get to you”</p> <p>Her father’s words repeated in her ears, slowly cooling the boiling heat that rose up in her chest. Her eyes narrowed at her mother, and she bit down the snarky reply she so desperately wanted to spew. When instead her father drew her attention, demanding,</p> <p>“You were injured?”</p> <p>Her Father raised a brow expectantly at her, his face still a firm mask while his eyes crackled, the spark of anger slowly burning in his irises. At that very moment, under the scrutinizing gazes of her parents, Felix wanted to shrink away. Her father, like her mother, was severe whenever Felix “damaged herself,” although only one of their concerns was actually for her well being.</p> <p>“Wait, that’s why I’m here? It was only a scratch. I got into an argument along the border, a skirmish really. I am Fine.”</p> <p>And ’Out of the Frying Pan and Into the Fire. Felix watched her father and cursed in her head. She should’ve never mentioned the blasted frozen border. If Thiradin’s eyes were a spark before they were now a wildfire.</p> <p>“The Border? What the Hell were you doing anywhere near those frozen beasts?”</p> <p>“I was doing my rounds and going hunting, the Haize faded for a moment, nothing happened, I beat them to stag, and they challenged me for it, I left my mark, and they left theirs.”</p> <p>Felix’s voice was tight, and she squared her stance. The lie was a small one, but it smoldered on her tongue anyway. This is what she had been trying to avoid. Her mother she could deal with at least, but her father never left any room for words beyond his own. Felix cursed herself again, and she stared right into her father’s disapproving gaze.</p> <p>“I’m fine really it doesn’t-”</p> <p>“Show me.”</p> <p>“No, it’s been stitched its f-”</p> <p>“Show me the mark now Felix.”</p> <p>Lord Thiradin stood from his throne, and it was almost as if thunder cracked. He was simmering. His eyes dared her to disobey, rage etched onto his face. Hesitantly Felix reached behind her and raised the trim of her tunic. The soft material eventually etched high above her shoulders and finally over her head so that only the wrap of cloth that held her breasts firmly remained on her upper body, the rest was bare for the Court’s hungry eyes. Felix kept her eyes on the floor as her cheeks warmed. Releasing one final huff she let that fall too, showing the bloody bandages along her shoulder blades.</p> <p>She was not willing to make eye contact with any one of them. Thankfully her hair and hand covered enough but She felt their stares piercing into her. She clenched her teeth. It felt worse than Anollen’s needle threading her flesh. She wasn’t weak; her wound had healed. She was Fine. Around her, she felt her father’s power rise, daring anyone to stare at his half-clad daughter, and suddenly all the stares left, everyone suddenly finding somewhere else to weigh their eyes on. Nevertheless, she could still feel their judgment and clawing interest.</p> <p>The wound that marred her skin had been appalling; it was something to behold. The Winterian guard had landed a strong blow, and if she had been facing the front slightly to the left, the wound would’ve taken her lifeblood. A deep swipe lay between her shoulder blades and the bewitching blue frost hex set a web of blue vines slowly spreading from the slash.</p> <p>“I’ve already seen Anollen, the frost will wear off in a few days, and it will only leave a small mark. I’m fine, Father.”</p> <p>His eyes never left her back, as his only offspring Thiradin’s chest tightened. Her injury was unacceptable too much of a risk to all he stood for. But, at the moment, his bloodline and Court mattered little, something primal inside the Lord of Autumn snapped. His stance tensed, and his look became almost feral. Male dominance displayed in every manor.</p> <p>“You will not be going anywhere near the borders again.” Unlike his previous bellowing, his voice was barely a rasp. A warning; danger seeped into his soft whisper.</p> <p>“You will stay behind these walls and where your mother can keep a close watch over you.”</p> <p>Felix’s head, shot upright, and her jaw fell slack. Disbelief and anger bubbled to the surface. Out of everyone in this blasted Court, her father, the general, the Lord of her home, had always stood by her. She was his daughter, his Commander. He had never forced her to be something she wasn’t. He never made her be what her mother wanted, a Lady, more like a pretty gift for some lord’s son to take and put on his mantle nothing of substance. Just an object.</p> <p>Her hands shook, and red seeped to the edges of her vision.</p> <p>“No, you can’t do that! I will not become some pampered pet cooped up in this ridiculous place! My home is out there where it has always been and where it will stay.”</p> <p><a href="desertflame-05.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-07.html">next</a></p>
