<body><h1 id="the-four-who-brought-it-all-down">The Four Who Brought it all Down</h1> <h2 id="chapter-one-190-years-ago">Chapter One 190 years ago…</h2> <p><em>Lance Past</em></p> <p>Through the small square window on the far wall, I could just make out the light of dawn. Bright colors washed across the sky, painting it in bright red and orange hues. The dorm was still dark, and even though the wall beside my bunk, I could hear the boys in the room next door heavily breathing. Once more of the light began to filter through, I shifted until I was stuck staring at the empty black frame of the top bunk. My eyes snagged on the twisted wiring, and the frame that used always whine whenever he put his weight on it. For a moment, I hear him toss and turn, it’s only the beginning of initiation year, and he’s trying in vain to cocoon the dorms paper-thin coverings around him. During those early days I almost wished him gone, given his racket. Almost. The Overseers had already come and removed his belongings and gear two days ago, but every time I look, I keep expecting to see his clutter. All of his small bits and bobs from projects long forgotten. He would somehow keep everything else immaculately clean, yet he always had something new to add to that one corner. And then the moment shifts, and the ice bath wracks my senses each and every time I realize nothing is there.</p> <p>The sun is almost up when the dorm’s automated lights come online. A long breath sighs from my dry lips and just for a minute. I debated, not moving. Drills would begin soon. The boys over in the next room groaned at the light, and faint shuffling noises echoed from the hall as drowsy cadets left their warm beds. I stared up at the frame one last time, and in the back of my head count 5-4-3-2-1. Just as the last number leaves my thoughts, the recording rings to life.</p> <p>“Cadet; Lance Gerrard, Drills have begun. The Sergeant requests your presence.”</p> <p>The nauseatingly soothing voice played over the corner speakers. Each time it’s always the same. Finally, after the third summons, I shift within the light synthetic material encasing my body and grimace when it clings from my cold sweat. “Yep, I heard you Francis” I finally reply to the automated recording signaling it could finally shut off.</p> <p>Quickly I remove the sweaty nightshirt and hurl it into the empty corner by the bed. Might as well begin my own crumpled pile. Trudging out of my bunk, I let the shower jet’s cold spray awaken every nerve in my body. The first morning of Initiation, I remembered every first-year screamed at the frigid water. At this point, we’ve all mostly blocked it out. “be bold and be cold” the drill captains would tell us each morning as we’d sprint into the lines with our teeth still clacking.</p> <p>“Cadet; Lance Gerrard, you are now 15 minutes late for Drill. The Sergeant requests you report to his command office immediately. Please Hurry”</p> <p>Francis’s voice chimes again, and I let out a curse. After washing out the soap, I shut off the water and towel dry as fast as humanly possible. My hair is still dripping by the time I’m fully dressed and sprinting through the Cadet block to the drill fields. The sun’s bright rays shine through the transparent glass roof over the drill fields, and it takes my eyes a moment to re-adjust. The glass is clear enough. One would almost assume we were really allowed beyond the compound’s walls into some actual fresh air, but we all know better. Even clear, the walls were always there.</p> <p>A small distance away, I make out the white uniforms of the 6th year cadets, my unit. On the other side from the cadets following their drills stood the tall Academy Watch Post. The watch posts were the only piece of architecture that was the same in each Academy. Otherwise, the building design and characteristics of each Academy were utterly unique to its purpose. Granted, it was only a rumor that the South Bay Academy for the Arts glittered and that the Northwood Academy for Politics &amp; Civilian Sciences was covered in Old-Time murals inspiring Council-approved activism. None of the West-side cadets had actually seen any of the other Council Academies but, the overseers made sure to mention the one commonality they all shared, the Watch Posts. Why the amount of security at other academies would possibly be necessary, I had no idea, but in ours it served an obvious purpose, keep a close eye over the up in coming soldiers. My gaze shifts from the intimidating concrete tower to the station beside it. All the air in my lungs seeps back almost deflating. The sergeant command station. Our morning cold showers, are nothing compared to the ice building up in my chest as if my body already knew this wasn’t going to be pleasant.</p> <p>“Gerrard. You were not present for drills this morning. Please, Explain.”</p> <p>Sergeant Kestrel’s quiet voice seemed to resound through the room. His face was angular as he was a tall thin man, and the sense of restraint seemed to ebb from him in waves. He was quiet, but his eyes sharper than the Drill throwing knives. He stood hands behind his face and seemed almost nurturing as he cooed. He softened almost to look understanding, but I know better. Under his soft exterior, he is the most brutal commander ever seen in the Academies.</p> <p>“Now, why would a dutiful cadet like yourself work so hard to ignore your alarm? We know it went through. The dorms sent word that you responded but declined to comply. Now, why would that be?”</p> <p>His smile was feline in grace, but feral hunger burned beneath cold amber irises</p> <p>The second it opened, my mouth felt smothered with thick cotton and dry as sandpaper. No words left, and Kestrel only seemed to widen his Cheshire grin.</p> <p>“Well, now we’ll need to fix that, won’t we? But seeing as your partner just left, I think it can let it slide this one time. After all, Benjamin will surely be missed, what an unfortunate accident.”</p> <p>Kestrel’s grin never doused even as he spoke Ben’s name. His eyes, if possible, seemed to sharpen more, searching and analyzing for any response. Everything in me shook. Even as my nails dug into my palms and warm wetness greeted my fingertips, I couldn’t move. He was looking for the blow so he could reciprocate ten times over, and I couldn’t give him the satisfaction. I wished he had dealt my punishment for the tardy. A strike or even the lash before all the others would’ve been better than the words knifing through my core; then again, he knew that.</p> <p>“Now, what do you have to say to your commanding officer?” His voice was sickly sweet in its all but whisper. And my teeth grit so hard my jaw felt as if it would crack.</p> <p>“Thank you, sir, for your compassion and generosity.”</p> <p>The words were a harsh bite, but he didn’t seem to mind. My eyes finally left the floor to give him one stiff nod. The anger sunk back deep into my chest, where it coiled tightly. I was expecting to be dismissed when another boy entered the station. He stood tall, perhaps a half-inch above my height; he had light chestnut brown hair that depending on the light, could’ve almost been confused for that of a dirty blond. He carried himself well, and beneath his white uniform, I could just make out a lean frame. What came off as odd to me was, I had never met or even seen him before. There were over a hundred boys in the out 6th-year unit alone, but over time we’d all gotten to know one another. Everyone was supposed to recognize one another; it was part of initiation training. Your unit was your home, your family; we all knew each other by now. But the boy who casually entered the sergeants’ office was utterly new. The new initiate noticed my stare as light grey eyes met my own.</p> <p>“Ah, Peter, good’ve you to join us. Peter, meet Lance Gerrard, he will be your new room assignment”. For a full minute, I couldn’t seem to concentrate on anything except staring at the stranger. Though his face remained pleasant and relatively neutral, something in his eyes changed as he stared back at me. It seemed neither of us had been expecting this.</p> <p>“Sir, I already have a roommate-” Peter questioned, still not removing his gaze from mine. The Sergeant’s eyes twinkled in delight as he smiled. Cutting him off before he could further protest, Kestrel responded almost purring, and shivers crawled up my sides.</p> <p>“Peter, your original roommate, was only temporary until we found one more suitable. Granger is a solo unit, and he will soon be moving on from this Academy after the next guard re-assignment.”</p> <p>Peter’s expression altered slightly from that of confusion to annoyance. Familiarity and almost awe struck me at once. Unlike the boy in front of me, who was a stark stranger, I knew precisely who Granger Belaire was.</p> <p>Granger was one of the older boys from the 6th year unit, and he’d recently been promoted to the lead of our ranks. He was our Rank-One cadet. Everyone figured he’d be shipped off with the other Elites as soon as the new class of initiates arrived. Why would they place a new recruit with our top unit? Again my eyes scanned over Peter. He didn’t look particularly out of the ordinary, just a stranger.</p> <p>“Now, seeing as you’re both acquainted, I think it’s time you head to drills; as I am sure Lance would agree, he needs to rectify his tartiness. You both could use it as ah well, perhaps a chance to bond so. Off you go, remember four extra laps. And Lance … I’ll expect no more of this misbehavior from you. Regardless of recent … events.”</p> <p>At least Peter had the decency not to protest, but as we both left the station, I could feel his eyes on me as they poked holes into the back of my neck. Warmth ran up, and I’m sure my ears were reddening.</p> <p>“Sorry, if I had known I would have dragged someone else with me into extra drills, I wouldn’t have come late.”</p> <p>Peter didn’t verbally acknowledge only gave a stiff nod before sprinting off towards the track, leaving me to catch up. Great … let the bonding commence</p> <hr /> <p>The hit came quickly, and I had to lunge out of the way as his fist grazed the side of my ribs. Still holding my stance, I struck out my foot to try and swipe his Peter’s from under him, but he dodged before I could make contact. My eyes met his grey ones as he threw other punch towards my right. I ducked out of the way and feigned left, leaving my right side vulnerable and hoping he’d take the bait. Sweat began to drip from my temples as I twisted my body to avoid his oncoming blow and instead, knocking my own fists into his own exposed side. A quiet grunt left Peter’s lips, and his eyes seemed to narrow. In any other circumstance, I would’ve smiled. The Other pairs were in their own sparing assignments around us, each of them quipping back and forth with the occasional laugh. Sparring was ordinary, and yet I could still tell they were watching us from the corners of their vision or rather watching him. And who wouldn’t? The stranger moved like liquid water, fast and fluid, with each blow.</p> <p>News had spread quickly that a new transfer had taken Ben’s place. When we had finished our extra mile, a few in my unit had tried to pull me aside to question about the stranger, but we were rushed to our next Drill before I got the chance to explain.</p> <p>My thoughts shook back just in time to see Peter’s kick aimed straight for my chest. Before I could react and dodge, the ground suddenly hit my back hard, and I was staring up into grey eyes. Around us, the boys in other pairs seemed to pause. Peter, unlike me, took the opportunity to let his lips lift in almost a smile. Heat thrummed up into my ears roaring, and for the second time, I twisted and grabbed hold of the foot he’d so kindly left on my chest, and with one sharp tug, I wrenched him to the ground. The air flew out of his chest, and while I could’ve taken advantage, I decided better to stay down. The match ended in a draw with both our backs covered in mat’s chalk. Without a word, I stood and watched the others keeping back to my prone partner and trying to keep a familiar face from my mind of who my partner used to be.</p> <p>After all the matches ended, we were sent to the canteen for a rest and mid-day meal. Usually, we were given free rein to sit with whomever we chose, but, for some reason, the Sergeants mandated we sit with our room block. So for the third time today, I was now stuck next to the tall stranger, and he seemed about as pleased about it as I was. The other boys at our table were pleasant enough. Ben had always been more social with them than I had. He could fascinate them with stories of whatever new idea he was working on. And now, especially, his absence was plain as day, and they wouldn’t really meet my eye, so we all sat silently. Two tables away, I looked up and saw Alex wave. Alex and his twin Jude had been my unit mates and close friends since our Initiate year. Alex gave me a concerned glance as he glanced over at Peter. I had to resist the urge to nod and roll my eyes. Alex and Jude had also been close to Ben, and my guess is they would be less impressed by my new roommate. Jude noticed our silent exchange and gave me a sympathetic shake of his head. My teeth bit into the side of my cheek, but I still managed to smile. I didn’t really care for sympathy, but I knew he meant well. Honestly, all I wanted was to leave the canteen and head to the training rooms. My fists ached from sparring, but I would’ve happily spent a few more hours hitting a bag.</p> <p>“Who are the two you keep waving to over there?”</p> <p>A relatively deep voice with a strange European lilt spoke next to my ear, and I had to hide my shock. He speaks. Peter’s words were short and concise, and he looked over to Alex and Jude.</p> <p>“Those two are my unit mates; they’ve been a part team since initiate year, the lighter blond one is Alexander, and the slightly more dirty blond is his twin Jude.”</p> <p>Peter looked one last time at the twins before returning back to his food. He didn’t acknowledge me as I stared at him; I was left wonder what he was thinking about.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes of silence later, the meal break ended, and we were given solo training, and finally, we were released to be on our own. A weight lifted slightly from my shoulders as I left everyone else to head to my room back in the barracks or cadet block as the overseer’s called it. The hallway felt too long as I passed the seventeen rooms before I reached my own. Luckily most people had headed to the more public training centers for the company. With luck, I wouldn’t have to face anyone. The door slid open after I placed my finger on the pad, and the familiar ding sounded.</p> <p>“Good evening, Cadet; Lance.”</p> <p>Francis’s voice sang its standard greeting. Traitor, I thought to myself as I remembered the automation reporting me this morning. My eyes glanced over to the bunks. My muscles whined, begging for a reprieve, but instead, I turned towards the blank wall to our cell.</p> <p>“Francis open the private training room, sparring ring, bag, lifting equipment,”</p> <p>I recited off the list in my head of my usual gear choice. Ben used to request the swimming simulator, which always clashed with my workouts and thus usually ended in a sparring match. My mouth twitched, remembering how he’d grumble whenever I won. There was no argument this time, and the wall panel in front of me simply melted away, and a second room turned into the private training center I had requested.</p> <p>My eyes zeroed in on the bag and the red hanging gloves. Francis would scold me for not using the gloves, but I wanted to feel the bag beneath my knuckles this time. I spun the thick tape between each of my fingers and closed my eyes. A soft breath left my lips as my fists made the first impact.</p> <p>The night air was brisk against my skin as they lowered us down on the line from the airship. The sound of the propellers was deafening. At first, all of us crouched and did our best to cover our screaming eardrums. Then the ship was gone, and we were on our own. Sixteen of us per team, all lined up. Our night gear made it difficult to see one another without the night goggles. I turn around, and Ben’s green-hazel eyes meet mine, he smiles though he motions me forward and I nod. Alex, Jude, Ben, and the others all hurry towards the forest line. Our mission was relatively simple: seek cover, avoid the mines planted in hidden locations on the mission field and retrieve the device; in this case, find the red and black flag. And of course, do it before the other team. Though our masks covered out mouths, the comms kept us in a continuous link.</p> <p>“Chilly Tonight, you’d think the commander would be nice enough to land us somewhere a bit more tropical or at least provide some sort of thermal reprieve. I swear I’ll lose my fingers by the end of this”</p> <p>Ben’s voice carries into my helmet, and I smile even if he can’t see it.</p> <p>“You want to be somewhere warm and humid in all this?”</p> <p>I ask incredulously. Our gear packed half our weight at least. I’ve never been a fan of warm weather I’m better suited for the cold. Ben, by contrast, would take a desert over a stiff breeze any day. I can tell he’s about to come up with some witty remark when Alex calls over</p> <p>“You two gonna keep chatting, or are we actually going to do a mission tonight?”</p> <p>“Yeah yeah, we’re coming”</p> <p>The team was quiet as we reach the tree line. At the head of the line, Jude scans the areas in front as Ben covers the rear. We each keep an eye out for anything unusual, and our scanners run constant checks for mines. It’s generally assumed the mines are not armed, but if you step on one, you fail the mission. In real life, you’d be a goner. Chills rake up my spine as we move further into the silent forest. Wrong. Something feels wrong.</p> <p>Anxiety radiates off our entire team. Jude is about to turn around and call for us to change course when Alex shouts out a warning, but it’s too late, and we all hear the shot fire. Snipers hiding in wait at the tops of the trees. Jude takes a hit in the shoulder and is down in an instant, and then the chaos unfolds. Ben pushes me behind a tree trunk as we do our best to seek cover. From the corner of my eye, I see that three more of our teammates are down. Alex managed to drag his unconscious twin behind a boulder, but we are all pinned down. I turn, and Ben’s eyes meet my own. The shots are knockout, you get hit, you lose. “What should we do? We’re pinned” His thoughts match my own, as we start to rattle off ideas when-</p> <p>“You’re bleeding.”</p> <p>The sharp voice broke me from my thoughts, and suddenly the forest and ringing shots vanish. Ben is gone. The last thing I see is Ben’s hazel gaze staring deep into mine, before the training center blurs to focus. Only then do I feel it, I’m still hitting the bag. Peter was standing just to my left, and his hand reached out to catch the swinging heavy-bag immediately, stopping its momentum. My breaths come out in short heavy bursts, and sweat drenches every inch of me. The whole world seems to take a minute to settle when I finally looked down gritting my teeth at my split and bloody knuckles.</p> <p>“Thanks”</p> <p>I didn’t meet his eyes. I wouldn’t. I expected Peter to leave or at least shrug, but he doesn’t. I could feel he was still staring at me. Un-relinquished anger coiled in my chest twisted and begging to be released.</p> <p>“Why aren’t you training with the others in the center?”</p> <p>“I could ask you the same thing.” His deadpan matched my own, his steel eyes never once leaving me.</p> <p>My words came out sour and harsh, I just wanted him gone. While, his voice wasn’t snide but brutally honest, and the anger again tugged inside me. The sudden urge to hit him and finish the match from that morning tugged. I had to bite my cheek to catch myself. If he was aware of my dwindling restriant, he certainly gave no indication. He just continued to stare. I eventually couldn’t take it anymore.</p> <p>“What! What are you looking at?”</p> <p>He was quiet for a minute, and then in his same neutral, calm tone responded. “I was just thinking, your hands were scabbed this morning; you do this often.” My eyes stayed firmly fixed into the spotless tile floor.</p> <p>“Good observation; the sergeants would be pleased.” My voice was quieter this time, and after having waited a beat for a response, then I turned my back and headed straight for the showers.</p> <p>I waited a full twelve minutes before I heard his footsteps finally recede. I released a breath I hadn’t realized I’d been holding, and I tap the controls once and the freezing water pelts into my skin.</p> <p><a href="topfour-01.html">next</a></p>
