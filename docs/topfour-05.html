<body><p><em>PARIS - Present</em></p> <p>Cold and unpleasant. Those were first thoughts that soaked through the haze were cold and unpleasant. Drumming aches rattled across my spine and neck. My shoulders groaned stiff, as I slowly adjusted. Whatever exercise Gisella had had me do, I clearly hadn’t warmed up correctly. I would need to bark at that women for putting me so thoroughly on my ass.</p> <p>Slowly I shifted and tried to move my arms up to massage my sore joints when I registered the clink and cool feeling of metal licking into my skin. The wave hit then, compounding memories and images, getting home, the fight, the invaders, Mum. Mum!</p> <p>My eyes flew open bleary and unfocused as my chest squeezed, air suddenly wouldn’t come, Mum, she was shot. Had they called an a medic? Would anyone find her? I tugged forward, twisting my body, realizing that my hands and arms were secured above my head. Cold raked through my spine as I searched around me still feeling an unseen fog over my senses. Above me shined a bright blinding light, it was too white, too cold. Unnatural stillness creeped over every sensitive nerve, the room was barren for all save but a small table to my left and a door. And then squinting through the glinting light my eyes make out a mirror. Unease pooled at the base of my spine.</p> <p>“Hello?”</p> <p>My voice comes out coarse, dry and raspy, sand paper lines my throat an in that moment I wish more than anything for a glass of water. Everything around me remained motionless, but the prickling feeling of someone’s eyes on me doesn’t alleviate. I can’t see them but it is almost like I can feel them, something else too, something sharp almost an invisible pulse against my body. It felt wrong. After blinking a few more times I start to notice everything is in complete focus. Wrong. All of it was wrong.</p> <p><a href="topfour-04.html">previous</a></p>
