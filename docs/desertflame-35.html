<body><p>“You’re right, of course you’re right. I’m sorry you came with something on your mind.”</p> <p>Aeilre emerged from behind the screen, shaking herself free of the heavy thoughts. She was swept in silver and blue silks that clung to her delicate frame.</p> <p>Thallan glanced across her, every bit the ethereal beauty and grace of the High Queen she was born to be. Respect and Pride warmed his chest. Then remembering the issue at hand with a slow breath Thallan signed,</p> <p>“It’s getting worse. I’m losing control of it”</p> <p>Aeilre’s twilight and ice eyes met his and stared intently almost as if scanning for injury or mishap.</p> <p>“The shifts, they’re increasing?” Thallan nodded stiffly.</p> <p>“And where you end up, close to the Mountain-” “I’m at the peak Aeilre, it’s getting worse”</p> <p>Concern knitted her brow and Thallan felt the cold coil of shame tighten in his chest. His shifts had always been a sore spot. He hated the look in others eyes, always in their eyes.That concern and pity. The very same looks everyone aimed at his kind before-</p> <p>Just as his frustration mounted ahead he remembered it.</p> <p>“But it was different this time, something pulled me back, a flash of something,”</p> <p>He sounded like a mewling pup. Thallan’s teeth ground tightly, his own rage at his helplessness rising. But he needed her council and if need be, permission to interrogate his new guest further.</p> <p>Aeilre’s curiosity twitched in her brow and she motioned for him to continue.</p> <p>“It is something strange, the intruder, somehow it relates to her”</p> <p>Thallan’s own brow furrowed attempting to describe what exactly he thought he understood.Afterall if he hadn’t seen it then he would hardly believe it.</p> <p>“Your new guest. . . you believe she has something to do with your shifts?”</p> <p>Aeilre glanced at the High Lord once again surrendering him to her penetrating gaze. Thallan again nodded silently waiting for her decision.</p> <p>Hot pricks of annoyance danced along his spine as he was reminded of the Autumnarian Faerie. Nothing but trouble.</p> <p>“Well if that is the case, I had better and go meet this guest for myself”</p> <p>Herself. His queen was going to see Felix herself. Thallan’s mind reeled. Fuck.</p> <p>Reasons for the uprising monarch not to take time to interrogate a simple border guard flooded on his tongue. One look in her eyes though and recognized his efforts would be futile.Thallan opted for a short bow, and turned dismissing himself. Her decision was made. His captive would soon face his queen and in that moment he hoped to all the hells, that either was ready for the other.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-34.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-36.html">next</a></p>
