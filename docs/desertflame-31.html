<body><p>Hedion continued to watch her and his mouth lit in a small shared smile as warmth reached her cheeks when he even seemed to brighten, she winked in response, little things even if nothing more she could allow herself little things. *** Felix lost herself in thoughts of her home up until a small clatter beside her bed, thrust her back to the Winterian manor, back to being a captive. Sitting up abruptly, Felix grumbled at the bonds on her wrists tightening in warning, whatever magic that held them there was intense and unrelenting. Felix scoured over the room, only still to find it empty. The hairs on her neck rose as she stilled, waiting for another sign that she was not alone. Seconds ticked by until a slight breeze in the still room passed by the bed rustling some of the sheets and Felix rushed forward even as the silken ties tightened and readied to pull her back her fingers gazed a rush of cold air. The slightest of shocks zapped at her fingertip, and Felix yelped, jumping back away from the unseen intruder causing herself to land hallway off the bed thoroughly knowing the wind out of her. “Who’s there? What are you?” Felix’s voice croaked out as she pushed air back into her lungs. Her ears strained but heard a faint airy chuckle as if the sound were carried off by the wind. Again she stared wildly trying to place wherever the threat may be but still nothing!</p> <p>128</p> <p>After her initial encounter with the unseen chuckling prick, Felix did her best to ignore who or whatever it was. Felix stared out of her room’s windows to the windows beyond, and for a spit second, she swear something was watching her. Too far for even her sharp High-Fae eyes to see clearly, Felix could just barely make out a pair of striking silver eyes flecked almost by flame-blue. They were staring directly at her. The rest of whatever creature it was concealed itself beneath the blankets of falling snow. The eyes bore into her reminding her of the her opponent stare from the night before. Without realizing it, Felix shivered, even as the hearth in her room continued to blaze. Her staring contest with the cold silver irises continued neither of them blinking, at first, it had been because Felix was afraid the moment she did the eyes would disappear but after awhile likely due to her interminable boredom Felix turned it into a game. She would look deep into the mysterious creature’s eyes and dare it to drop its stare first. Even as her eyes watered and screamed for her to blink, Felix kept up her game, and though she could barely see them, she thought the eyes even seemed to lighten understanding her game and daring her right back. A smirk lifted Felix’s face as she perched on her bed, she was sure she was going to win, just as the silver eyes seemed just about to break their eternal starring match, a scuffle behind her ripped away Felix’s attention. Just like before, there was nothing to be seen, and when she drew back to the window, the silver eyes were gone. God damn it! Felix snarled into the ‘empty’ room. Whatever it was had cost her, her victory. Felix thought back to the strange silver eyes had she made them up? Out 129</p> <p>of boredom, perhaps? Felix sank back onto the flat of her back once more, staring at the empty ceiling. If someone didn’t arrive soon, she swore she would find a way to either escape her bonds or strangle herself with them. Anything would be better the just waiting in the annoyingly empty room. Felix deadpanned another wary glance at her void confines when something finally caught her attention. *** The room was still vacant, but it was different. If possible, the blade above the mantle seemed to gleam, even more, the rugs covering the cold stone appeared pristine, some of the warn dust from before, gone, new logs had been added to the hearth, the room had been sought after. It had been cleaned. The banister depicting the fierce leopard crest had been switched. In its place was a new tapestry, one showing all four crests. . . the bright golden Chimera of the Summerian Court, then to the right the familiar crimson-orange and aquamarine wyverns intertwined at the tails to make up her family’s crest. The two intertwined flames of Autumn. Next came the pearlescent coral-green and blue hues of the waves swirling around the graceful Hippocampi of Spring. And once again, as Felix’s gaze returned around the circle, she again came across the Winterian Frost Leopard. As she stared, her breathing paused choke in her throat as she met the Leopard’s eyes. A very startlingly familiar gaze stared back towards her, silver and ice-flame irises brightly shining, glared out from the tapestry, and Felix again looked towards the window. Could it be a coincidence? It must have been. Perhaps the weaver at the time had had a penchant for silver. For Felix couldn’t believe she had met the gaze of a real Frost Leopard. 130</p> <p>The beasts were said to have been wiped from even the Winterian lands centuries before. She must have been mistaken, and yet still, the feeling of unease nagged at her. Nonsense, just her mind spending too much blasted time alone. Steps from down the hall drew Felix’s mind away from the eyes that would haunt her for nights to come, in the doorway instead of her expected babysitting squadron stood an ethereal, beautiful woman. Her frame thin and graceful reminding Felix of the rare woodland nymphs that would inhabit the forests near Autumn’s southern border. Unlike her other captors, this woman had tanned skin, almost as dark as her own minus the freckles dotting Felix’s nose and cheekbones. The woman’s eyes were green, but unlike Felix’s emerald irises, this women’s were the color of grassy mid-day fields shinning beneath the dual suns rays. But lastly, what caught her attention was the stranger’s hair, not Winterian dark locks or even white-blonde, nor Autumnarian auburn or chestnut, no the woman’s hair resembled gold, the color of dried cornhusks and straw shining brightly. The woman was gorgeous for Felix to behold, and at that moment, her bright looks clicked. “You’re of Spring” Her words almost a slight whisper, though Spring bordered her home, its people rarely left their lands, and Felix scraped through her memories to see if she’d ever come across someone of spring ever like the women before her. The faerie in question smiled, kindness, as well as a dash of humor, painted her features, and she nodded. Felix watched frozen as the lady flowed towards her. Before, Felix had been certain the fluid water-like grace at which Spring</p> <p><a href="desertflame-30.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-32.html">next</a></p>
