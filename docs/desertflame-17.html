<body><p>before her.</p> <p>71</p> <p>Chapter VII Felix Dark shimmering violet scales reflected her glow and shadows crawled away from her light as she made out its enormous size. The ancient one was magnificent. Her father had told her stories of the mighty Dragon that ruled her lands long before the ancient faerie lords. The Dragon were the monsters that held the most primal powers, the barest and strongest of Nature’s power. Before her stood an Ancient, A Dragon. One of Limeare’s firstborn. A scream of terror pushed up her throat but she clamped her jaw tight to stop it. Her knees trembled and she struggled to keep the foolishly brave mask on her features. “Now you see me faerie you know, what I am. you now understand I am something to fear. you dare threaten me with the power my brethren gave to your ancestors centuries ago? the flames do not belong to you. Faerie proved honorable and true but since we gave them power they have grown corrupt and cruel. you nor your kind deserve the power flowing through your lifeblood. you must earn the power you hold so dearly” A new scream burst from her lips. Blistering flames ignited every cell in her body. It was as if the beast was tearing apart her body slowly ripping through her. Like it was shredding her very soul. Any agony she felt before intensified. Death would have been mercy. Tears traced down her cheeks Bile and vomit chased up her throat and a terrible chill invoked her.</p> <p>72</p> <p>“W-what have you done?” Her flames burned her palms and guttered quickly. A clawing empty feeling raked at her chest and her back wound stung and ached a new. “You may be a dragon scale but you have lost the truth of your ancestors. you, faerie will learn the price to power, I have taken what my brethren gave your bloodline. Without your fire, you will learn the consequences, your father and his kind have wrought on this world” She felt bare, weak, vulnerable and alone. It was gone. All of it was gone. “Please” the words died on her lips. Terrible cold-like none she’d ever experienced hissed against her torn flesh. Though it was silent she knew the beast was still there. Its eyes still gazing down onto her. Hatred flowed through her as she again stared into the blackness. “You won’t kill me yet you take the one sole piece of me I have left” Her voice was below a whisper but she knew it could hear her. “Faerie if that power is all that you are. then you are not yet ready nor strong enough to have it.” The beast’s voice was quieter this time and all condescension and anger were gone. Instead, there were only notes of varying sorrow. Felix felt as if all her flame had been doused. Her body now only thrummed with flagging exhaustion. Her knees gave out and once again she fell to the gravel beneath. Her breaths turned slow and she could feel death’s grip tightening yet she knew she wouldn’t fully succumb after all now was not her</p> <p>73</p> <p>time according to the ancient. Slowly Felix closer her eyes and let the heaviness in every inch of her body take control. Just before sleep fully engulfed her Felix heard one final whisper. “Mother of light, air, and flame, of earth and water and ice. Mother of the eternal balance. please hear me now. She is ready now, take her to where she will be safe. She must learn to survive, she must heal” If she’d had the strength Felix would’ve told the beast it was no use. She was a traitor to Autumn and the Empire there was no place where she would ever be safe now. Her eyes shut once again but for a fleeting second, there was brilliant flash and then finally painless oblivion.</p> <p>74</p> <p>Chapter VIII Thallan Thallan watched patiently as the wind swept across his face. The snows weren’t as heavy as he expected. His feet crunched along the path across stones and fallen branches from the now barren trees. His eyes combed along the trail, searching for something out of place. It wasn’t unusual for the hounds to get spooked during the night, and usually, he could simply dismiss it. However, this time he had felt it. Something in his bones, his core pulled at him. The barrier winds picked up into a high pitched howl as he stepped closer to the edge. His breath fogged before him in a warm mist in the frigid air. Although it was coldest along the barrier, Thallan could barely feel the chill. His coat was thin and his leathers underneath were purposely light. He preferred the feel of the frosted gusts over being laden with padding. He reached the clearing and immediately his breath left his lungs for a moment. The polar lights danced in fluid beauty before him. It wasn’t the first time he had laid eyes on them but each time the ancient magic that hit him in waves always took his breath away. Green and blue and deep purples played a mirage before his eyes. The magic seemed so thin and simple and he could just make out a watery image of the frosted land on the other side. For a moment his mind wandered to what was happening on the other side of the uncrossable border, The Haize. The Haize was the last conjoined magic between the courts of old. It had been created as a punishment and as a protection against the Winter. It’s depths 75</p> <p>that of constant change. Sometimes it was think as the mountain glaciers guarding his Court’s coasts and other times it was barely a glaze between Winter and the lands across. Thallan mindlessly reached across and let his fingers brush against the mirage, fire pulsed up his hand a threat and yet he still let himself get close feeling that odd tug. At once he shook his thoughts away and remembered why he was here.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-16.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-18.html">next</a></p>
