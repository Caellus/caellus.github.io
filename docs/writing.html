That said though I love working on my bits of stories, various plots and tons of characters.</p> <p>As of right now I am keeping my novels more private as I continue to work on them but here I can talk about my writing process as well as some resources I use.</p> <p>As of right now I am currently working on one of two novels.</p> <ul> <li>A Deserter’s Flame</li> <li>The Four Who Brought it all Down</li> </ul> <h4 id="process">Process:</h4> <p>In terms of how I write, it really is somewhat of an unplanned mess XD</p> <p><em>Plot</em></p> <p>For my first novel I ever tried which I finished in middle school (The Four Who Brough it all down is its current revision) I started first by gleaming an idea for plot, either from imagining the world setting, in this case a dystopian future, or by using other stories I liked as a guide.</p> <p>Some of it too depends on what sort of novels you like to read and or want to write about, for me I love fantasy and dystopian fiction, those two areas for me light up something in me and I feel most absorbed in those types of worlds.</p> <p><em>Characters</em></p> <p>Once I settled on a plot, in this case a shady dystopian government kidnapping specific individuals with a higher chance of a key mutation, (yes very x-men I know). So then once I had a base idea it was time to make characters.</p> <p>Initially I started by first sitting down at an avatar creator, one of many you can find online and one I created faces that felt right names began popping up in my head.</p> <p>For me I am pretty lucky that once names come, I usually have this odd sense of the person in my head, but if I still feel blocked I use the character guide I linked below to help me further refine them.</p> <p>With my first novel once I had the character names and faces, their dynamics just started to make sense, I paired names together and even made maps for how they’re relate to one another. Who would love eachother, who would despise each other etc. I find mapping out character dynamics really helpful because it helps promote backstory, why they feel that way and it also usually causes fun scenes to start popping into my head.</p> <p><em>Actually Writing</em></p> <p>So this is the step I struggle with the most which I think is common and the blank page can be daunting.</p> <p>With my first novel, what I did was I actaully wrote the last page first especially since I had planned a cliffhanger so I had fun writing out all the excitement and then once I finsihed the last page, then I wrote the first.</p> <p>This isn’t how I decided to try writing my second novel, but it still did help because it gave me end points and then all I had to do was connect them, which can seem easier than just writing with no physical end in sight.</p> <p>Other than all of that, I generally just try and continue the rough idea of events I have in my head and then also add any occasional scenes that just pop in my head.</p> <h4 id="resources">Resources:</h4> <p>Here is a great <a href="https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com">character name generator</a> Their site is also really great for really any names, as well s writing guides etc.</p> <p>For less fantasy esc stuff here’s a good <a href="https://www.namegenerator.biz/last-name-generator.php">real name generator</a></p> <p>Good in-depth <a href="http://www.epiguide.com/ep101/writing/charchart.html">character sheet</a></p>
