That said though I love working on my bits of stories, various plots and tons of characters.</p> <p>As of right now I am keeping my novels more private as I continue to work on them but here I can upload new projects, character names and ideas etc.</p> <p>As of right now I am currently working on one of two novels.</p> <ul> <li>A Deserter’s Flame</li> <li>The Four Who Brought it all Down</li> </ul>
