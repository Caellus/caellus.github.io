That said though I love working on my bits of stories, various plots and tons of characters.</p> <p>I don’t directly have a plan for how I will share my works here wihtout making it too much to scroll through but soon as I figure it out, this is where it will be.</p> <p>As of right now I am currently working on one of two novels.</p> <ul> <li>A Deserter’s Flame</li> <li>The Four Who Brought it all Down</li> </ul>
