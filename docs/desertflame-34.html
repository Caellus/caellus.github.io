<body><p>Thallan slowed as he neared the palace, reminiscent memories of his old home and those who came before him presiding there surfaced.</p> <p>The palace’s grand deep-set ash wood frame against strong dark stone greeted him, foreboding and yet nostalgic of all that came before.</p> <p>The palace itself remained a thing of beauty both in and out, deep engravings from generations past and tongues long forgotten paved the entry way.</p> <p>Through heavy towering doors shown the entry hall. Vaulted high silver-coffered ceilings with decorate beams carved, depicting that of Legend glowed in torch and hearth light. Silks and plush furs upon the clean floor holding in the fortress’ undeniable warmth. Swaths of whites and silver-crested blues hung against the dark wood a strong beating heart of the Court he so loved.</p> <p>An enchantment cast long ago by a traveling sorcerer, allowed frost, crystalline in beauty, to hang weightless in small cloves, above heads against the dark ceiling, hovering and casting small dashes of light to dabble onto those below. Small shimmering natural chandeliers. And if one were to watch for long enough they would watch the frost move ever so slowly as if to reflect the shining stars of the heavens. Thallan knew if he were to mount the grand stair cases to right and left of the grand entrance he would see similar elegance across each and every step. Rather than that of sparkling jewels and riches, more the reserved beauty of a warm welcoming home.</p> <p>Thallan moved briskly attempting to push out the Palace’s glooming familiarity. He did not have time for this. Rambling thoughts shackled on his shoulders casting a shadow over the High Lord. After many grand winding corridors and halls Thallan finally approached the Master’s quarters.</p> <p>In an age before, Thallan’s own parents lived and slept in those rooms and so too was Thallan expected to, but the palace had never truly been a home. His Manor instead became his glowing warmth. And when She arrived it gave him every excuse to leave the palace and reside in his home.</p> <p>Ever still the Leopard High Lord over his court.</p> <p>Fore when she had surfaced the domain of his parents became the new home of the rising Queen.</p> <p>Each of the four Courts held their own soverign High Lord or Lady, but above it all, light born is the Monarch, the one high Faerie with the power of all four courts. The Protector of all of them, one born after the death of the last. At least until her.</p> <p>The first Winterian-born Monarch since the age of Six Kings.</p> <p>His queen, and Limeare willing, the Matriarch to all in Tehlaeya.</p> <p>Thallan in that moment did not think of who he approached as his queen, but rather the women he found all those ages ago, battered and scared at his door.</p> <p>Thallan approached Aeilre Alessandra-Anneculus of Winter opening her chamber doors as if they were his own as only he could. His ears strained adjusting to see if he sensed her presence and if she was alone.</p> <p>No one else tried nor held enough standing to allow such an informal greeting to a monarch other than perhaps Aeilre’s sister in arms.</p> <p>Regardless, Thallan was undeterred. Only the faint brush of her gown against the smooth stone registered and Thallan proceeded forward.</p> <p>“Issarael is that you? I am just finishing up could you hand me that brush?”</p> <p>Her voice smooth and fluid like the dew of a new spring glided into the room and Thallan for a moment debated leaving and allowing his queen her privacy, but then thought better of it. It was too urgent.</p> <p>With steady deliberate steps Thallan edged closer, picking up the female’s scent as he was sure she would gather his recognizing he was not her closest friend the Spring Court’s healer.</p> <p>“Thallan?”</p> <p>The High Lord of Winter gave an unimpressed grunt.</p> <p>“That took too long, no way in all of the Hells do I sound the same as that nymph”</p> <p>Aeilre to her credit let out a short laugh. These days not many teased her, but Thallan always treated her as one of his own. The laugh settled into an easy quiet as Aeilre finished her final adjustments to her gown.</p> <p>Thallan let himself turn and peruse the space. The hearth towards the head of the room crackled and glowed healthily, and above like in his abode hung a tapestry of heritage in intricate weavings.</p> <p>However the Queen’s chambers held some different air perhaps the femininity of the space or just Aeilre’s rare authenticity. It was open and where his held an air of foreboding pensive silence.</p> <p>Aeilre’s seemed to burst even in quiet with light and life. From the moment of her conception Aeilre lived her life in great secret much like Thallan’s own sole existence.The new Winterian monarch, a direct violation of the laws erected after the great wars and uprising. Born with the power of the four courts thrumming through her mixed cold-ice blood, a light where for so long none was to be found.</p> <p>Since her coming of age, Aeilre poured herself into her surroundings, silently refusing to stay trapped or hidden ever again.</p> <p>Even as he drew nearer Thallan could feel the raw brilliant power flowing out from the queen’s shaded silhouette. His own magic reached out to sense it, sending small crackles of sparks through the air. No doubt the queen could feel the silent greeting. She was quiet for a long time, not making to emerge despite his presence. Thallan could sense her weariness.</p> <p>“How are you holding up?”</p> <p>Behind the screen in the far corner where she dressed the new-rising Monarch of Tehlaeya paused. Understandably so, even despite his comfort with the queen, Thallan rarely embraced idle chatter in such a manner towards any, but his lieutenants.</p> <p>“It’s war Thallan, our war.”</p> <p>Aeilre’s voice hummed softly, heaviness and exhaustion balled in her heart. All the weight of what was likely to befall hoisted upon her shoulders. Thallan remained still only to nod, he like many others all around would gladly give their lives if it was in service of the woman before him. He and his people would see her claim her birthright, even if it meant war.</p> <p>“It is war, but it is also survival Aeil, it is not violence without cause, we are fighting for our very survival.”</p> <p>He spoke the words, what they both knew to be true. Somberness heavy in his heart as he knew what this would weigh on her.</p> <p>The barrier between Winter and the three bound Courts crumbled with each passing day threats to both of their peoples loomed higher.If they did not take action, Thallan was certain the other Courts would not give them much choice.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-33.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-35.html">next</a></p>
