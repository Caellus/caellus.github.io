<body><p>Her blood, spilt and he’d wanted to tear himself apart.</p> <p>He’d gone too far, and yet when he tried to stop and rectify his mistake, the Autumnarian had the gaul to fight against him; she was hurting herself!</p> <p>In the end, he’d had to use his magic to stop her even as she’d stared at him with betrayal and outrage darkening her gaze as if to silently scream out that he had cheated. Something in him squirmed under her scrutinizing gaze, he’d suddenly felt wrong. He’d genuinely meant before not to use his magic.</p> <p>He’d relented when she laid down the rule. Though the urge to resist and feel his blood freeze with his own magic was strong, he would honor her demand after all; if he didn’t, it never would have been a fair fight. He’d let his magic change to a low buzz barely perceptible, but when he pinned her, it rolled in waves. He’d scarcely kept it at bay. When he realized she was hurt, his control snapped. Thallan’s scowl smoothed over as he emerged from the great hall, ice and snow met him in the wind. The cold was a welcome reprieve after recounting every part of his encounter with the flaming faerie.</p> <p>Snow crunched under his boots as he strayed from the stone-lined path. As his steps wandered, his gaze traveled to the rising mountains. The Frost seemed to glow pearlescent under the waning moonlight and opaque night sky.</p> <p>Faint traces of emerald and cobalt flashed through the air. A beautiful reminder forever of the Haize and the barrier between his people and all the Courts.</p> <p>Before realizing it, Thallan’s steps stopped as he reached his Manor. Far and away separated from the rest of his people there it stood. Slowly his frustration thawed as he grew closer to his home.</p> <p>Though his domain back within the center of his Court loomed within his White Palace, officially the lair of the High Lord, this manor darker and alluring was his true home.</p> <p>Torches lit up the windows beckoning the wayward traveler to its warmth. No one knew of his true home, but his lieutenants and . . . now the Autumnarian captive. He didn’t let himself question why he didn’t simply send her to the barracks or even a cell to heal.</p> <p>He wouldn’t dwell on his thoughts. He’d found her, and then also coincidentally re-wounded her, thus his responsibility. Nonetheless he would not let himself draw too much into these thoughts, distractions. He knew he should have ventured inside his friends would be waiting for him, as would his new feisty and injured guest, but weight pounded upon his shoulders, and he longed to run, to just keep his distance just for a moment longer. A familiar call from the wind whistled in his ears, calling him away; away from it all. Beckoning him to abandon in the cold and ice.</p> <p>Thallan continued past his glowing windows, past the Manor’s grand doors, and up the mountainside, growing farther and farther from the weight that seemed to cling to his shoulders. The wind roared around him and pulled at his magic, and finally, as one with the blissful cold, he let go. Light flashed in a single bright burst, and painlessly</p> <p>Thallan’s bones cracked and reformed. Skin and clothes morphed into a thick white pelt of fur, spots emanating the snow dappled trees covered his form and where the High Lord of Winter stood before now prowled the powerful form of the last Winterian Frost-Leopard.</p> <p>As his breath fogged through the air, everything crew clearer sharper as details of the night and snow came to light. Scents of swift wind and prey carried to him, and every sense was suddenly more.</p> <p><em>Let Go,Come Farther Away, you’re of Cold and Ice, join with the Wind Come Away</em></p> <p>Whispers on the wind ticked his ears as he felt himself roaming farther towards the mountains. Freedom and cold echoed in his bones, effortless thoughtless freedom boomed in his mind as his large paws thrummed down on the crunching snow up and up the mountain. Distantly the thought of his manor and those waiting for him filtered through, but the wind’s whispering howl quickly ebbed away at the thought and all others attempting to usher him back.</p> <p><em>Come Follow the Wind, Let Go. Let the Cold Bring you Home Let the Cold Free</em></p> <p>The wind picked up until it swirled around him, his magic fully melded with the elements as he continued up. He reached the Mountain’s peak and the stars seemed a breath away as the stars and black sky enveloped him. The Mountain was above it all, breathless thoughtless freedom.</p> <p>Before the Thallan there it was, the pool of midnight, the lake’s black waters calling him ever closer, echoing the whispers of the wind.</p> <p>The snow leopard prowled further entranced by the sparkling midnight depths. Small tingles of warning pricked on Thallan’s neck, his fur rising yet still the whispers called and abandon brought him closer towards the precipice.</p> <p>Just as Thallan lifted his paw towards the inky lapping waters, a sudden emerald-gold flash blew in his eyes, drowning out the wind and all its whispers.</p> <p>For a single moment he could almost smell something, spice and heat, and then it vanished.</p> <p>Time around Thallan paused briefly as he stared into the pool. Warning and exhaustion pulled at his senses, drawing him away from the waters.</p> <p>Thallan’s thoughts remained absent as he continued farther from the lake. Fatigue weighed down his bones until he finally slumped laying atop the mountain. Just before blackness pulled his senses into sleep.</p> <p>Thallan saw only stark emerald flecked with turquoise and gold pushing him to rest. Emerald eyes with gold danced in his dreams as the last of the great leopards slept atop the great North Mountain.</p> <hr /> <p><a href="desertflame-26.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-28.html">next</a></p>
