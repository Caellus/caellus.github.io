<body><p>”You mean, let them catch their deaths on the Winterian Border! They’ll lose their way in those woods. The Dark wood! None of those men are from around here Hed, they’ll all catch their deaths from the game they’re supposed to be chasing!”</p> <p>Hedion opened his mouth but shortly after closed it. Her second’s shoulders sagged, and he held his hands in surrender. He knew an argument worth fighting over, and this wasn’t one of them. Underneath his breath, Felix was sure she almost heard him mumble</p> <p>”stubborn mule.”</p> <p>She smiled and took a strong-hold of his left hand. She promptly ignored the warmth that reached her cheeks upon the touch.</p> <p>”Come on, we have to reach the mounts quickly and reach the fools before one of the wolves or Light’s sake a Lygra find them before we do.”</p> <p>Felix heard Hed release one last sigh of annoyance but put up no further protest. Together with the two of them bounded towards the mount’s stables. Eight steeds were already missing, the Hunt had already passed through, and retrieved their mounts. Felix stared into the dim straw brimmed stables, and she beamed as she spotted her stallion. At least none of the courtly bastards had dared take her mount. ”FireFly” She whispered to herself as she threw herself at her horse.</p> <p>The sizable beautiful creature was a lightened brown almost golden in the right light with a bright white mane of long silky strands. Like a light in the dark Firefly could stand out, a warhorse unlike any other with the blessing from the Light herself, a single small mark blessed into the horse’s flesh just above the eye marked her, a Wind Weaver, swift and strong and fast as the gusts she rode upon.</p> <p>FireFly nestled into Felix’s open palm and gave a snort of recognition. Though Felix spent the majority of her traveling on her wings and preferred it typically, her heart swelled with pride as she pat her mount. Felix fetched her saddle; finely crafted embroidered with small enchanted gems that would grant strength and swiftness to the rider. Effortlessly she hoisted herself up and waited for her second to do the same on his steed. Where Felix was proficient, Hedion was born to ride. He held beautiful form and maintained a grace while on horseback that pointed to his Elven heritage.</p> <p>”Y’know your father is going to try to stop you . . . and when you disobey, he’s going to get upset, right?”</p> <p>Felix flashed Hedion, a grin to which he rolled his eyes. The two kicked their mounts forward and raced with the wind towards the Northern Wood and the Winterian Border. Air whipped her face, and Felix could feel some of the overbearing weight leave her shoulders. Hedion looked equally pleased despite his previous reluctance. The hills and village passed them by in a blur, quickly changing scenery to the woods and foliage that surrounded the Autumn Court borders. The Dark Wood.</p> <p>Legends of old claimed had you not a destination in mind or a sound tether home a wary traveler could venture into those ashen trees and never make it out again. There were tells of some who’d entered and found guardians waiting and only those who could fulfill their tests pass through. Some said it was because of the Wood’s closeness to the Haize, that somehow the barriers ancient Magics had enchanted the Forrest.</p> <p>Whatever the case Felix didn’t believe a word of it. Wood was after all wood. But the Hunt was altogether different. Where trees may only be trees, what other creatures were found within, were another matter entirely. Excitement and anticipation for what was to come was addicting. The free feeling of hunting, getting ready to fight, was like a warm breath of exhilaration through her very soul. It was like her body craved it, the violence the sense of showing everyone who she was and what Felix was capable of.</p> <p>The Forests deepened, and their dense canopies blocked out some of each setting sun’s blaze as Felix and Hedion foraged on. They were far enough behind that she couldn’t hear the hunting party’s laughter or shouts, but she could still make out their tracks. The two faeries crept through the foliage studying for the hunting party, scouring for some sign of where they’d gone off to. Eventually, they reached a fork in the path, and on one side, Felix saw the path that would lead to the Village’s hunting grounds where she was supposed to lead the lords to hunt their game. On the other side was a thinner winding path to lead Autumnarian sentries to their posts along the border and to the Haize. Hedion pulled up beside Felix and studied the beaten path. He let a curse slip through his lips; he saw as she did, the hunting party had wandered down the winding latter path. Felix didn’t bother cursing after all this, is why she lead the hunts. Not the courtiers who spent their time behind jeweled keep walls. Ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous, but not surprising. Felix gave a light kick to her mount’s side and raced off down the century path towards the border.</p> <p>Whether it was from ignorance, confusion, or stupid arrogance, Felix didn’t know or care; either way she now had to ride deeper into wood to save the hunting party before they became something else’s prey.</p> <hr /> <p>In truth, it was a bit of both ignorance and arrogance that lead Lord Davern down the wrong path. He knew the trail he lead the party down was not the way to the village hunting grounds. He had been somewhat indignant on the Hunt three weeks prior, when the hunting party had been taken to the grounds,</p> <p>“there was little sport in hunting animals in these leafy kennels,” he had said to his comrades over a large tankard of ale.</p> <p>So this time, he was determined to lead an actual hunt where the animals weren’t prepared or cornered for the hunting party. What Lord Davern had not realized was one; his own ability and that of his fellow courtiers at hunting did not much exceed downing animals in leafy kennels or those whose wings had been previously clipped. And two; Davern believed the path he was leading the hunting party down was the path to the less structured “soldier” hunting grounds. He was not aware that no such grounds existed. It was merely Wood.</p> <p>So in part, he had arrogantly gone down a different path, but ignorantly he did not realize or have any intention to hunt along the border route, which was infamous for being the most dangerous stretch of the Dark Wood. Needless to say, it was understandable that he was deeply shocked when he came face to face with the snarling Frost hound and its Ghoul keeper when they stepped directly into his path.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-02.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-04.html">next</a></p>
