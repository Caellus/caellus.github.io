<body><h2 id="chapter-xi">Chapter XI</h2> <p><em>Thallan</em></p> <p>The Autumnarian lay still beneath him even as he felt his coils release from around her, so much like how he’d found her. He couldn’t help but stare down into her blank face. Her features finally relaxed she looked … serene.</p> <p>The strong scent of iron and flame still berated his senses. Blood. He had initially thought it was a small cut on her, and then he had assumed it to be his nose, which stung more than he would ever admit. But when he had caught her under his weight, and he heard her cry out. He knew then something was amiss, then the scent hit him in a wave.</p> <p>Her Lifeblood was flowing from her. He didn’t know how he knew but he could sense it deeper than any other scent clinging to her. Without another thought, he’d ended the fight. She would need to see a healer immediately.</p> <p>The wound upon inspection from what he could see was a horrific clash of ripped flesh and infection. The tunic Catalyia had given Felix was dyed crimson as more blood soaked through. Under the broken stitches, Thallan’s eyes fell onto the haunting ice-blue and sapphire web stretching past her shoulder blades. Cold magic pulsed under his fingertips roaring to meet his. Laced beneath her skin foolishly sewn up was ancient Winterian magic.</p> <p>A Frost Burn. One like he’d never seen before. Thallan cursed and carefully maneuvered her fragile form. Meanwhile, his mind reeled, trying to understand how she’d fought with a wound that should’ve killed her long before she crossed over the border.</p> <p>The little Autumnarian in his arms should be dead, much less able to fight, high faerie or not. She should’ve been barely able to stand, much less able to est Catalyia and give him a fair run for it.</p> <p>Once she was steady against his chest he carried her back below stage, ignoring the whispers coming from the crowd and the stares burning into the back of his skull from his lieutenants. He would deal with those consequences later.</p> <p>Catalyia was there to greet him, her face ashen, and her violet eyes wide as she took in Thallan and the crumpled Autumnarian in his arms. Thallan could feel the questions radiating off of her as he gently lay the Autumnarian onto a small cot waiting. Even as her glare mixed in with worry poked and prodded at him, Thallan still ignored his friend. Instead, he focused on laying a light sleep over Felix something to keep her down long enough for him to figure out what in hell to do with her. Once he was sure she slumbered softly, he faced Catalyia. As she opened her mouth to speak, he beat her to it.</p> <p>“She’s in bad shape, a Frost Burn Cat. She needs a healer quickly. Take her to the Manor and have the others convene there. Don’t call too much attention to yourself.”</p> <p>Catalyia’s eyes widened again, staring at the Felix’s sleeping form, but upon Thallan’s last statement, she rolled her eyes and seemed to shake off her shock. Again even though he could sense she wanted to protest or at least release one of her many questions and retorts yet Catalyia thankfully only nodded and remained silent as she passed along orders to transport the Autumnarian.</p> <p>Felix’s form was still under sleep even as guards approached to help move her. Thallan’s gaze stayed on Felix’s crumpled receding form until the guards and Catalyia dissapeared into the tunnels soon to reach the Manor. Once he was sure they had left, and no trouble had risen, Thallan forced his feet to turn away, and rather than take the tunnels, he pushed through the oaken doors and filtered back into the fray of the markets.</p> <p>Even as he trudged past the familiar vendors and market stalls and into the main hall, Thallan’s thoughts still drifted to his strange opponent.</p> <p>What had Mother Light been thinking when she’d dropped Felix at the border? His face seeped into a scowl as his brain recalled their fight. The unconscious faerie below the enchanted oaks was nothing like the vengeful fire wraith he’d met on stage. She had smelled like hot iron and the hearth, and like embers still keeping warm and of spice and leaves. She was a flame herself. Every essence of stubborn burning pride and wrath.</p> <p>The way her eyes had danced like licking firelight in a light breeze. She was quick and hot to temper. He had smiled to himself. Teasing her had been an unexpected delight. It was rare that someone could so easily get Thallan to lose his cool composure. Daen and Catalyia had been trying for decades to get him to ruffle his feathers and yet the little fire faerie had achieved it in moments.</p> <p>In the beginning at her first attack her hit to his jaw had been a force he hadn’t honestly expected, some of his own men couldn’t force a blow that hard, but her impulsiveness had gotten the better of her. She fought nothing like his men either. For one thing, no other male would kick there. No one would force the other to endure that as Thallan would likely be feeling for the next fortnight.</p> <p>She fought dirty and quick but smart when she didn’t lose herself to anger. When she had flipped him, Thallan was caught more in surprise than in pain. It had likely been more than a century since anyone, but Kaerynn had forced him upon his back. Then she’d kicked him in the face, and his own anger rose to meet hers. His restraint had rattled for the first time in years possibly decades.</p> <p>The Hellion was asking for trouble. When he’d flipped her under him, something purely male and satisfying settled over him even with the urge to meet her blow for blow that had almost overtaken him. He no longer bothered him that she was female.</p> <p>She fought like a male brute of her kind and so he’d treat her as such, but then he’d sensed her blood. A different rage had ignited in him when he’d scented her life’s blood.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-25.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-27.html">next</a></p>
