<body><h2 id="chapter-xiv">Chapter XIV</h2> <p><em>Felix</em></p> <p>Someone was moving, was the first thought that Felix registered as black oblivion faded. Thankfully her head wasn’t pounding quite as ruthlessly. Mother above she needed to stop waking up like this.</p> <p>The pitter-patter of light feet filtered into Felix’s sharp ears, a slow groan slipped from her lips. It was too bright as the morning’s creeping glare sifted through her dry eyelids. Just outside of her vision Felix could make out a slight, shifting silhouette. It was then something pulled in the back of her mind, she wasn’t home, whoever these people were they were enemies.</p> <p>Silently Felix did her best to calm her rising chest and instead let her sharp ears filter in everything around her.</p> <p>“Since you’re up would you like some water? I’d guess you must be thirsty”</p> <p>And just like that Felix shot up. Before her stood perhaps one of the most delicate of females she’d ever laid eyes on. And the most striking deep-night irises laced in pale blue. They glowed at her like the new fallen snow, that which she had only begun to catch glimpses of from her rooms windows. Blue eyes and speckles of something else, something hidden beneath the surface.</p> <p>In this woman’s eyes Felix felt both a weight and a light for which she had never known its equal. The woman all together despite her eyes, and slight gaze seemed at all else, ordinary. Dark rosewood locks hung well below her shoulders curling gently. Her clothes were light, the color of greying skies with brushes of white and ice blue. A servant or house maiden perhaps.</p> <p>“What are you doing in my room? And why mother above can’t someone at least warn me before I get a new babysitter?”</p> <p>Felix’s throat truth be told was dry and water would have been lovely, but her own peaking fury won out. She was tired, tired of waking up with no sense, tired of constant intrusions and tired of no bleeding control.</p> <p>“Do prisoners where you are from normally get awarded such privileges of who, and when their captors should arrive?”</p> <p>The woman’s voice laced with dry humor. Felix’s cheeks heated, truth be told she was mortified at just how used to her confinement she’d become. Of course they would keep her imbalanced and unaware. Behind all the pretty sheets and silks still lay prison walls.</p> <p>“No, though we don’t normally make a habit of hiding behind false niceties either. The water, this fine room and even my silk bonds, whatever you’re seeking for Winterian, regardless of finery I promise you will not find it in me”</p> <p>By the time she’d finished Felix’s chest pounded as small pants escaped between parted lips. Felix waited for the woman to react, to shout or curse or even just to attempt to prove her wrong, little prepared her for the genuine laugh that echoed around her room.</p> <p>The female’s featured lightened drawing in true mirth and her eyes even dared grow glossy as if from unshed tears. She was laughing at her. Felix was certain she’d said nothing laughable. Between this woman and Catalyia, Mother above.</p> <p>“Had we known providing decency would make you so uncomfortable, a cell and stinking chamber pot could’ve easily been arranged. I must alas confess Autumnarian you give far too much credit to our scheming ways, the drapes before you are just that, drapes and water, only that to quench thirst.”</p> <p>Felix sat silently her eyes glowering and sharp canines ever so slightly bared. This wench was bearing down on her patience and hot embarrassment colored the tips of her ears.</p> <p>The woman indeed did seem earnest despite Felix’s caution. The room did only seem like a warm dwelling and Felix didn’t need to sniff to tell the water was clean. Despite all that, she wouldn’t lower her guard, being caught a fool was not an option.</p> <p>“I’ll take it you don’t want water then”</p> <p>“No”</p> <p>Releasing an amused sigh the female put down her raised water pitcher on a nearby table. Felix waited for her to move to leave, but the Winterian simply sat at a waiting seat beside the bed and looked out toward the window.</p> <p>Neither woman spoke, and Felix again took the time to study her new intruder. She was not like the others. Unlike the two babysitters before who had baited Felix, this woman was not built like a warrior. Her frame held a delicate languid demeanor and her features were gentle, softer than that of someone trained on area fields. She was more slight than Felix, though the two were of similar height. This woman despite her lack of muscle or warrior’s poise, held her head high.</p> <p>She spoke with enough prowess Felix found it hard to believe her simply a maid of the house. Though then who was she? To her knowledge the Winterians did not have a High Lady, though like everything else, Felix was beginning to doubt all she knew. Something unpleasant stirred in her gut. The woman was odd for certain, her eyes sparked something Felix could recognize, determination.</p> <p>Not unlike the other females Felix had come across, here the female seemed entirely comfortable and not at all shadowed in a Male’s domain. Odd.</p> <p>The woman glanced away from the fogged-crested window and tittle her head at Felix. She resembled a bird in that moment, wide curious eyes and a thoughtful expression, as if Felix were a nut she had yet to fully crack. It seemed neither entirely knew what to make of the other.</p> <p>“What brings you to Winter Felix?”</p> <p>The question was placed gently, almost hushed as if trying to coo the answer from her knowing it was something harsh. Felix’s throat tightened.</p> <p>While in truth, she did not choose to ever even think of entering the Winterian border, it remained she was not welcome home either. She couldn’t tell this woman that though, no one could know truly why she was brought here nor who she was. Knowing she was in exile would lead to too many questions. Felix gulped in a breath and hardened her features.</p> <p>“That, Winterian is none of your business, nor concern as last I checked you are not the High Lord, and if that prick wants an answer he can bother to ask me it himself”</p> <p>Felix hid the quiet test behind her peaking annoyance, perhaps given her bait at least she could find out who she was dealing with.</p> <p>Undeterred, the Winterian chuckled and then turned towards the shut room doors.</p> <p>“Alright fine, you all can come in now”</p> <p>Just as the words left the woman’s mouth the chamber doors burst forward and there stood four wide-eyed alert lieutenants and in the center a scowling Silver eyes.</p> <hr /> <p>The room thrummed heavy with the combined twangs of magic, and for a moment all that could be heard was the sharp crack of the hearth.</p> <p>The room wasn’t the least bit cold yet still Felix’s skin rose to goose flesh as she eyed all of her captors.</p> <p>While the lieutenants seemingly at ease upon sensing no threat, Silver eyes apparently found no such respite. From feet away Felix was sure she could hear his sharp canines and teeth gnash together and perhaps even the slightest growl puncture the air. Beside her, the female seemed only to huff indignantly,</p> <p>“We were talking. I told you it would be fine, what will it take for you to actually listen”</p> <p>Eyes never leaving Felix’s, Silver seemed to stiffen for a moment under the females scrutiny and hissed behind his teeth,</p> <p>“All respect majesty, you must forgive me if I am not eager to see your theory put to the test. Autmumnarians have a nasty habit of catching those under my care unaware”</p> <p>His eyes blazed and from the corner of her eye she spotted Catalyia grimace, yet all Felix could find herself focusing on was one word. Majesty.</p> <p>A royal, a royal born to Winter. Now it was Felix’s turn to stiffen and she pivoted abruptly re-evaluating the female beside her. As Felix’s fists balled and she drew her mouth open to snarl the room seemed to lower a few degrees and panting breaths left Felix in fogs.</p> <p>“Usurper”</p> <p>Chalky ash covered Felix’s tongue and air grew tight in her throat. It was her. The Rising Queen, Winter’s usurper, standing right beside her. The war, all the slaughter that was to come, and the cause of it all stood less than an arms reach.</p> <p>Venom, acidic and broiling rolled through her as Felix lunged, her eyes all but conveying the flames she so wished to unleash. Before even her silken bonds could respond Felix felt herself suddenly freeze. The magic in the room burst to life.</p> <p>It was not Silver’s doing. Even as he snarled and thrust forward ready to intervene, instead pure white blinding light held Felix immobile. The magic and scent were like nothing she’d ever encountered.</p> <p>Wisps of sea, flame, ice and traces of earth assaulted her senses and the light while firm didn’t sting or bite as the cold had. Felix gaped at the brunette, where her eyes had once resembled snow now glowed like that of the purest white sun gaze. Magic, a Monarch’s magic.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-35.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-37.html">next</a></p>
