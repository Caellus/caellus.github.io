<body><h2 id="chapter-xix">Chapter XIX</h2> <p><em>Ciliren</em></p> <p>Ciliren’s joints ached. Sweat clung to the divit in her brow and dripped along her hair line, her back and underarms had already grown damp, and the saly sting had begun to brush past her lashes and into her eyes. It’d been nearly an hour and the hall’s gleaming gold clock mocked her with every passing chime. An hour of hunching over, sponge and polish in hand as she scrubbed at the ash-ridden tile floor.</p> <p>The great hall had certainly seen better days. Mindless scrubbing, she and many other had been brought in to scrub, polish and repaint the burnt wilted hall. She remembered when she first laid eyes on it after the burning. Every kitchen hand had felt the brush of heat through the Palace walls and she remembered the cold dread that gathered in her bones.</p> <p>It was as if flame made flesh had brushed its hand along the walls and ceiling, combusted from the inside, all from the Bastard heir.</p> <p>Talk had spread for weeks since the disaster, the Highlord’s fall, and the Commander’s disappearance. Hundreds of men had been sent out in search of the missing heir.</p> <p>Ciliren’s thoughts drew back to that night when she’d served the haughty female. She had felt Felix’s stare that night, felt as she spotted her brand, and the hideous scars cascading over her hands. She had loathed Felix that night, in her finary, despite her admiration for the heir’s defiance, her pride was unbecoming.</p> <p>Ciliren remembered when Felix had put her in her place. Gods knew it was a miracle that Felix had been the only one to lose control that night. Cil, had felt the rising heat beneath her veins and the last ridules of her frost had rissen to meet it. Felix had seen, Cil was sure of it and yet she said nothing. The oddity had stuck with her for days afterward. Why would the famed Autumnarian heir, sword to her ruling father say nothing and spare a Winterian magic user? Perhaps if the Mother Light bore any sense of humor Felix really was the traitor many believed her to be, but Cil had a hard time seeing that.</p> <p>Quickened steps drew her from her deep thoughts and she continued her ruthless scrubbing as they neared. Light only knew she didn’t need anymore attention focussed on her. Peering from beneath her lashes Cil caught the form of a male brushing through the great hall. He was tall, more so than most of the kitchen boys and other slaves she’d grown accustomed to. His lightly pointed ears claimed him High Faerie and yet, the sharpened angles of his face and the way he seemed to move, more fluid suggested somthing … more, something different. Ciliren watched as the male drew nearer though his focus never drifted towards her, he only seemed to scan the space, his face drawn in a concerned deep frown. Curious. The male wore leathers, and a gleaming steel blade hung from his hip, the hilt adorned in bright twisted vines of gold, she would have assumed noble if it weren’t for the rest of his more rugged attire and his alert stance.</p> <p>Nobles never stood like that. From all her years of service, the countless times waiting on courtiers and the high born, she’d come to be familiar with the staunchy haughty lazy stupor they all seemed to exude, so important that nothing could possibly touch them. Bitter distaste coated the roof of her mouth at the thought. No, this male was different, his eyes scanned to acutely, his shoulders, too stiffened, and his form too steady, never seeming to quite relax, perhaps a soldier then, though Ciliren had never seen a Palace soldier in such a uniform.</p> <p>Amber eyes eventually drew towards her and Ciliren had to duck lower from being caught watching. Attention no matter from who had never been good in her experience over the years.</p> <p>”You, slave girl. What’s your name”</p> <p>His voice wasn’t gruff, instead it was calm and collected, no hint of condescending or disrespect merely using the only title he seemed to have for her. Cil stilled for a moment.</p> <p>Slave girl. A small sigh sifted through her lips and Cil looked up to meet his stare.</p> <p>”Ciliren M’lord”</p> <p>The words were dry and dusty in her throat. Her palms began to sweat and she could only wonder what he could possibly want with the likes of her.</p> <p>”I am no lord, Commander is enough”</p> <p>She couldn’t help to hide the slight rise in her brow. Not only was it infrequent that one denied a high-bearing title whether they were deserving of it or not, many liked to believe themselves higher in their station when compared to slaves. But also, commander. He then was the heir’s replacement.</p> <p><a href="desertflame-42.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-44.html">next</a></p>
