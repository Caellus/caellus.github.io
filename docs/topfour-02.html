<body><h2 id="chapter-two-present">Chapter Two: Present</h2> <p><em>Paris</em></p> <p>The crowd roars in my ears. The man-made ring is tighter than usual, but the alleyway is smaller than usual too. There was barely room for everyone to fit as-is. My eyes scan the dirt-covered hoard of people. Most were from the harvesting district. The location for the fights changes each week, and thus so do the crowds though, there are a few regulars. This week we were in the damp poor Harvest District. Every fight has a crowd, no matter the district. No matter the space, weather or time. Regardless of wealth, electricity, and status, every district has people who want violence. Here the farmers and laborers were looking for entertainment, for pain, and most of all, a distraction. They want something to take their focus away from their hungry bellies and their aching bodies. Something to make them forget that they’re stuck here too poor to live anywhere else. Something that can make them forget that tomorrow or the next day someone they care about could be gone. They want something violent. Something to cheer on. Better they can hide behind that than face their fear of the violence that follows them home each day. Fighters bring them a welcomed distraction. The roar of people pushing and cheering has become familiar to me now. I push my way to the center of the ring, and suddenly the loud roar quiets to whispers in under a second. I can feel their eyes on me. I hear it behind me the whisper</p> <p>“Astrid Hunter” and then my other name gets murmured to my left and a smile slips past my blood red painted lips.</p> <p>“Suicide Mark”</p> <p>That one always brings a smile. While the crowds look for violence and savagery, I’m here for the calm. For the ice, the cold, unfeeling freedom of focus on the fight surging through each of my nerves. Again I run my eyes through the crowd. Some of them are afraid. I guess that’s what happens when you gain a reputation. Some look excited. Those are the ones who want blood, and then there’s the last reaction. Some people, very few these days, look unimpressed. No matter how far my reputation flies, it seems there’s always someone who can’t see anything but the small blonde before them. My eyes meet a snobbish broad man, likely a grower. He gives me a half-smile and lifts his eyebrows. Challenge accepted jackass. Wordlessly I nod, and it begins.</p> <p>All around him, the crowd backs up. He steps forward into the ring, and then he’s closed in.  Now the only way someone leaves? Get beaten to a pulp, knocked unconscious or well win. The man grins and slowly removes his dirtied uniform that stuck to his sweaty form. He isn’t in bad shape. Sometimes the men who bumble into the ring have a half-ton heavy beer gut. In those times they’re insulting me. This man is strong, not rigid and disciplined like those of the patrollers and soldiers, but one clearly honed from years of harsh labor. On his arms are long twisted vine tattoos. A black spiral thorn design is on his upper back. If not for the sneer on his face and the obvious ogling, he could be called attractive. But alas like all others this man remains a disappointment.</p> <p>Besides the man’s brash arrogance, he actually seemed to at least have some level of intelligence, he begins a set routine warm up and for a minute I’m left to wonder how many times he’s done this before. The crowd however isn’t keen on giving the man time to stretch, but I ignore them. I want a good fight for once. Because he isn’t some drunken idiot, I want the time to have a more evenly matched fight. A challenge would be nice. But doubtful He stretches out his muscles and jabs a few blows in the air in front of him. Strong. I make a mental note not to let him hit me as much as I can.I can practically hear Gisella, my instructor’s disapproving reprimand in the morning about why I keep coming into her studio black and blue.  Gisella never asks me why I always come in scraped, and I’m thankful. I’m not a fan of lying. I already have to lie to Mum. She does me the courtesy of not forcing me to cough up some dumb excuse.</p> <pre><code>When my opponent finishes his &quot;warm-up,&quot; the crowd cheers in anticipation, we begin to circle one another. the man is stronger than I am, but I&#39;m faster and more coordinated. He lunges forward to make the first blow; rookie mistake. I sidestep out of the way, and he misses by a mile. I duck under his next swing and make two strong, fast hits to his exposed side. he puffs out a hard exhilaration, and his amused smirk switches to irritation. I have to resist the urge to smile. Now he&#39;ll begin to understand who he just challenged. We go back to circling one another, and this time he learns, he waits to see my move. I thrust forward and fake right, but he doesn&#39;t take the bait, and he blocks my attack left. His block is strong, and small vibrations of pain creep up my hand. I decide my best move is to take a strong defense and let him get frustrated until he breaks his focus and becomes distracted.</code></pre> <p>The crowd is less than pleased with my strategy. They boo and fuss at my dodge, and someone behind me shouts “coward.” I turn around for a split second to glare at the offender and pick them as my next victim, but instead, my eyes catch on a strange man towards the back.</p> <p>He’s taller than some of the crowd around him, and he has a lean build from what I could see. He is a light dusted blond and has a lighter skin tone than most of the District residents. Means he was likely visiting from his home sector to see the fight. Unusual but not unheard of. His clothes are nothing out of the ordinary, a plain white shirt and jeans that are remarkably still blue and not mud-splattered. But it’s neither his build nor clothing that caught my attention. It’s his eyes.</p> <p>They’re sharp and bright. Unlike much of the animalistic, wild crowd, the stranger seems relatively calm, and his eyes aren’t clouded with the influence of substances or bloodlust. He’s watching, genuinely watching the fight. His eyes meet mine, and for the first time in a while, a small chill shivers in my spine. He has dark grey eyes that hide all emotion behind them except hunger, curious, ambitious hunger. He’s nothing like the others around him. Everything in his eyes tells the same message; dangerous, very dangerous. I blink, but he’s still there and still watching me. Everything about his stance reads predator if you look close enough. Even his relaxed, slouched posture meant to fit in hides the fact that he is ready and waiting. I try to turn my head, but my gaze is fixed on him, and then his gaze shifts behind me, and a split second later, as I’m turning around, a fist comes barreling towards my face.</p> <p>The blow was hard, and my eyes flash with lights for a second. The crowd suddenly silences for a second, and they all wait for my response. My senses are temporarily disoriented, but I can see the next shot coming, and I duck. My entire jaw pulses with pain. I’ll have a nasty mark in the morning. I step back away from my opponent and spit out the small amount of blood from biting my tongue. The tattooed man is back to grinning, and I glare at him.  Now I’m pissed.</p> <p>“That was a cheap shot,” I whisper to him, and before he can react, I lunge towards him, He took a shot while his opponent wasn’t looking literal definition of bad sportsmanship. Regardless that I was distracted, he still deserved to get beaten into a pulp. I dodge each throw he swings at me and focuses on all of his weaknesses. His ribs are bruised from my hits earlier, and with enough force, he’d collapse. Of course, I could simply hit his face enough to knock his lights out. I take a slow step forward, ready to turn his face black and blue when I look down at my fist.</p> <p>Shit. One of my knuckles was already raw, and if it split, I would be screwed in the morning for practice. Gisella’s going to kill me. Well, that means I have to you as few hits as possible to bring the stupid oaf down. Ribs it is then. The tattooed man watches me closely, waiting for my strike. Surging forward, I feign one way, and as he dodges, I sweep his feet out from under him with my leg. He falls hard and freezes as the wind is knocked out of him. If I were in a better mood, I might give him a chance to recover, but he hit me in the face. Without giving him a chance I pin down his legs under my knees and deliver two quick, decisive strikes to his ribs breaking one rib on the right and bruising the other, He lets out a whine of pain from underneath me. I press down on his ribs as I lean down to his ear. A hiss whistles through his clenched teeth.</p> <p>“Next time, I suggest you figure out who you go up against before you get your ass kicked again.”</p> <p>The man tries to squirm, and even wack one final hit my face, but I dodge and kick him hard in the face he blacks out as his nose makes a satisfying crack. The man-made arena is silent as it waits for me to pick my next opponent. My eyes look over every face searching for one in particular, but the stranger who distracted me before is gone. I look around once more when finally I see the faint outline of a tall, lean man leaving the alleyway. Just before he goes around the corner, he turns halfway and meets my gaze. The hairs on the back of my neck rise as he smirks, gives me a small nod of perhaps approval, and then disappears onto the open roads.</p> <p>The crowd grows restless, waiting for me to pick the next fighter; instead, I look towards Elliot, my contact or manager, as he likes to say and give him a nod. I’m done for the night. He raises an eyebrow but shrugs and signals for a different fighter to take my place. Astrid Hunter gave the crowd a show, and now it was time to go home. *** The overhead lamps flicker, and the dark shadows occasionally engulf pockets of the street as the ill-serviced bulbs switch off and on. Through the visor, I keep wary of each corner, expecting some thug to jump out. Most around my neighborhood have learned to avoid the blonde on the bike, mostly because it never goes how they think it will, it never goes well for them, and they never get my bike. The old thin is barely worth anything at this point anyway, but in the slums, a transport is like gold. It’s a way out, easy cash even if it barely runs. My fingers tighten as I steer towards home while every now and again, checking the mirrors. No one was behind me, but the uneasy feeling never leaves, and my mind continues to drawback to the man, his clean clothes, piercing eyes, and his demeanor of viciousness show up behind my eyelids every time I blink.</p> <p>“Get a grip Paris. He’s just a man. Likely some prissy upper-quarter snob bored and looking for a little excitement”</p> <p>My words are hushed as I continue maneuvering closer to Mum’s driveway, actively trying to ward off the small voice lingering in my mind whispering that somehow that one man is not at all what he seems.</p> <p>Mum’s dilapidated house loomed ahead, the electricity is spotty, but in comparison to some of the homes around here, it was a miracle. Before stopping, I check the mirrors one more time and breath a long exhale. Years ago, I made a promise whatever happened from the fights could never follow me home. Even Elliot thought I lived at least five blocks down. I wouldn’t let any of it come to Mum’s doorstep. Satisfied that no one was sitting on my heels, I turned off the bike and walked it into the garage where I chained it against the wall; the garage was easy to break-in, the chain; fortified military steel? Not so much. The chain was a rare commodity and was worth almost as much as the bike. Ignoring my continued uneasy feeling, I slipped through the back door and up the creaky steps as carefully as possible. Praying, I won’t wake Mum.</p> <p>“Paris, Honey? That you?”</p> <p>I cringe but keep ascending further, no longer bothering to cover my footfalls, “Yeah, Mum, it’s me.” I can hear the whine of her rusted wheels come from the kitchen as she moved towards the head of the staircase to greet me. Two dim lamps come from the kitchen and outline Mum’s form and shine slightly off the old wheelchair. Her face is scrunched in worry, and for a minute, I regret making her worry before I remember the cash Elliot stuffed in my fist before I left. “You shouldn’t be waiting up for me; Mum, y’ know that. The Doc said you need rest and staying up till God knows what hour in the morning I don’t think is what he meant” Mum looks at me a moment longer, and I think she’s maybe caught the slight bruise on my jaw, but she doesn’t mention it. Instead, she sighs. “I know, Pae. I know, honey, but I just can’t sleep when I know you’re out. I know you aren’t studying, so there’s no point in lyin’ about it anymore. Just as long as you’re out there, I’ll be up restless hopin’ you come home.”</p> <p>On another night I’d argue with her, but I’m too tired. I can feel the exhaustion in my bones, and I’ll have to leave at dawn to meet Gisella, so instead, I simply lean down and press a short kiss on her brow. We both know what it means; I’m sorry, but I won’t change, I love you. I step back and around her wheelchair, and she doesn’t try and stop me. The house is small, and it barely five steps before I make down the short hall to my room’s door. The room’s interior is still it’s flourishing pink hue and stuffed animals and belongings from a different time greet me, and I drop my knife I keep by my side just in case, let my belt fall to the floor and strip out of my clothes. I don’t let my eyes wander. I don’t look at the smiling pictures hanging on the walls or the toys of a younger girl strewn around the room. Nothing’s changed, all the belongings we had when it happened have stayed. No matter how much has changed and that I’m not the girl who used to smile and jump onto swing-sets or love pink and dress up dolls, it’s all we have left of before, so it stays.</p> <p>I was nine when Mum had her accident when she couldn’t take the bike anymore, nine years old when she couldn’t work anymore. I was nine when it all went away, no more dolls, no more toys or natural smiles, I was nine when I crawled to Gisella’s studio and had to explain I couldn’t pay for any more lessons and I was nine when she took me in and let me continue to train. I started working at eleven, and four years later, Astrid Hunter was born, and now three years have passed, and Astrid has become my second skin, suicide mark, one of the most renowned pit fighters in the North American sectors. My eyelids droop just as I hit my childhood bed, not even bothering with covers as soon as I hit the pillow I’m out. ***</p> <p>By the time dawn crawls around, my eyes barely open, and my skull feels like a bug smashed on an upper-sector transport windshield. Groaning, I slowly unstick my stone-heavy limbs from the springy mattress and stretch. After shifting into some of the clothes stuffed into my dresser, I flop down the hall and notice Mum’s door is still shut. Hopefully, she’s sleeping. I didn’t have to see her clearly last night to know she was worried and her body, as frail as it is, needs the rest. Without waking her, I quickly grab a bagel from the pantry and rush out of the house. The sky is still darker, and flitters of light begin to shine across the horizon, and I unchain the bike and start the long ride to Gisella’s and the central city.</p> <p>Almost two hours later, the sight of tall buildings reflected in the early morning light began to lift from the horizon. Paths to the city were usually swamped with transports going too, and from so I learned, while technically less legal, it was much faster just to take some of the older-aged highways. Though they were marked as in disrepair and wouldn’t be able to hold the weight of traffic, one small bike and rider was fine.</p> <p><a href="topfour-01.html">previous</a> <a href="topfour-03.html">next</a></p>
