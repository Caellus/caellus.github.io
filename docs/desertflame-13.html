<body><p>55</p> <p>Chapter VI Felix It felt like drowning. Felix was a young child again. The river was broad and whipping between the rocky shores. It was her second Hunt, and her Father had finally allowed them to stop and rest and water their horses. Felix’s back and hips hurt from the saddle jabbing up at her whenever the horse ran. Her father had walked off to see if he could spot anything worth sport. Felix meanwhile stared down at the green grass below her feet. A speckled silver butterfly flew in and out underneath her mare’s feet. Felix struggled to reach the ground as she unhooked her feet from the shortened stirrups and plopped out. The quick whoosh around her as she fell towards the ground suspended around her, and a giggle flew out of her. The grass was soft beneath her fingers as Felix reached down to try and touch the butterfly. Its wings fluttered and shined in the bright sunlight. Felix watched its pretty wings beat, and she almost thought she could hear them flap. The butterfly flitted up as a cool breeze zipped through the air. Behind her far away, Felix heard her father’s voice. His deep timbre echoed across the canopy, and Felix just turned her head as her foot missed the cliffside. The whoosh roared in her ears, but this time the fall was longer. Her father yelled out in alarm just as cold water slammed into Felix’s senses. *** The guards began to drag Felix down to the Prisons bellow. She would be locked up and, depending on her father’s state, possibly executed. Treason. She had to run. She needed to get out. Suffocating. She was suffocating, 56</p> <p>her father, he was going to die, and she was going to pay for it. She would be a traitor. As they moved out of the dining hall and towards the west of the castle, the two guards stopped, and the one to her right reached and unclasped irons from his belt slowly looming towards her. Chills lifted the hairs off her neck. She eyed the irons, and she began to shake. They would Not put those around her wrists. She would not be bound like some beast she declared in her mind “Your Wrists” Felix raised her wrists and with remarkable speed shifted and kneed the guard between his legs. The man groaned and crumpled pitifully while the one to her left made to swing she caught him with a counterblow just below his ribs and then another blow to his face. Both men fell before her. Imbeciles she thought dismissively. If she ever made it out of this she’d speak to Hedion on finding a time to retrain the Palace guards. Quickly Felix bound their wrists and ankles in irons. And then she ran. Breaths whooshed out of her lungs in and out and in and out. Each hallway and passage looked that same, the labyrinthine underbelly of the palace was not a place she had mastered. She now regretted her choice to spend so much time away from the palace. Left. Right. Left and suddenly her feet came to a sudden stop. There was a fork. Two passages. Felix felt like a rabbit stuck in the fox’s den. Footsteps were coming fast from behind her. The icy damp stone stairs below the palace echoed in their approach. She had to keep moving. With a last steady breath, Felix forced her feet forward. Muscles groaned in protest at her elevated speed but she ignored it. 57</p> <p>She chose to move right, she kept running until the torches stopped. In front of her looming, opaque Darkness blocked her path. She cursed in a dialect from the border villages and she was sure Hedion would’ve smiled had he been beside her to hear. Of course she chose the side with no torches. Light. She needed light. Her pulse quickened the footsteps were gaining on her. Light.Warmth crackled in her hand and she remembered the pleasure and warmth of the sun. Bright flames licked and danced in her palm. She flexed her fingers and sparks erupted from her fingertips. Her small glow flooded the small damp tunnel. With quick steps, she made her way careful to make as little sound as possible There were no signs of anyone behind her. She was safe for now. Water dripped slowly from the ceiling, the sea above her head created a rare coolness bellow and Felix shivered. The small torchlight emanating from her hand didn’t hold back the darkness in front of her. She could see only a few steps in front of her when a soft breeze swept through the cramped space and blew out her gentle fire. She cursed. Her voice echoed along the walls and she was almost tempted to release another curse at her foolishness for talking at all, but that wouldn’t do any good. The tunnel had to let out somewhere she thought, but as she continued on the winding trail she grew less and less sure of herself. Soon she reached a staircase going down. . . Down was not the way she wanted to go but going back up wasn’t an option. By now the guards would’ve swarmed over the underground passages looking for her. She had injured her father and maimed the commander. Her breath caught and a sea of nausea shook through her stomach for what must have been the fourth time. She hunched over and gagged the threat of releasing her dinner on the cobblestone rose. Images of Elryan’s charred flesh and her 58</p> <p>father’s devastated eyes before she struck him morphed in front of her. Tears fell down her moistened cheeks she begged Mother Light that her father would be all right. Elryan was likely dead and Felix avoided the thought of her father’s fate. Too much. It was all too much to think about. Instead, she stood. Her legs almost buckled and her head was hazy from the quick upright position but she had to keep going. “Please keep him safe” Her whisper poured out the fear and devastation she tried to keep hidden. She stared into the darkness threatening to engulf her and she stiffened. She was going to get out of here and then she would make it right. Somewhere deep inside Felix knew it would never be the same and that she would likely die in the deep darkness but there was no point if she let that thought finish. No, she wouldn’t let herself fall into a pit of despair never would she fall prey to that weakness. She would keep moving forward. She had to. Her foot stepped forward when a loud and deafening CRACK! Resounded off the walls. Every hair on her neck and arms stood up. Her mind screamed silent curses as she tried to move to step away from whatever weak stone her weight threatened but the stones began to crumble and fall. The passageway shook and Felix jumped back to avoid the new fissure dividing her path. Adrenaline flooded her veins as her feet left the ground and</p> <p><a href="desertflame-12.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-14.html">next</a></p>
