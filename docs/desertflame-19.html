<body><p>Again she opened her mouth to call out to whatever it was breathing and thumping. She had half a mind to ask the beast just to devour her, be done with it because, at this point, its insides would be warmer than the cold. The other part of her mind chided the reaction and instead only wished to shout at the thing to please stop moving. Neither of these burst from Felix’s blueish lips; instead, she only managed a whisper which was stolen by the wind before the stranger could hear it. What could have only been an eternity passed before Felix finally felt herself stop moving. A low grunt sounded in her ears right before a thwap of something cut, and the world slipped from her, and a different weightless feeling sent a warning into her thoughts just as she hit the icy solid earth . . . hard. Felix grit her teeth at the impact, and in her mind, she shouted: “Why in Hellae’s blasted pit, do I keep falling?”. Padded feet shifted beside her, the beast or whatever it had been was gone. A groan left her throat oozed from between her lips, when a low chuckle echoed beside her. Someone was laughing at her? Disbelief and annoyance shot from her head to her toes. She wished her eyes would open so she could see the scoundrel’s face when she bashed it in. 80</p> <p>Felix squirmed attempting to stand but found her wrists and ankles bound tightly together. How had she not noticed that before? Curses flew like summer flies back and forth in her head, but of course, her lips could not manage to spew a single one for she seriously doubted anything would pierce the thundering wind. Felix ended up banishing thoughts of useless insults and instead experimented a few small movements. Her bindings were tight and precise, too precise to be the palace guards . . . then who caught her? Felix wiggled her frozen fingers and shifted her arms, searching for slack, “Stop that.” A low growl cut through the air around her. The voice was male, cold, not angry . . . more like bored. Felix stopped her movements, They were bored? Really? The simmering feeling of her annoyance crackled through her. Her thoughts begged for her to let the bored male know if he unbound her, she’d guarantee he wouldn’t be bored anymore. She waited for him to speak again, but he didn’t utter another word. She debated struggling still to get a response, though, the possibility of being struck for disobeying quickly changed her mind. Her dry throat cracked, and she like every time before could only whisper. “Unbind me.” For a moment, the air remained silent but slow footsteps more direct than the earlier beastly thumps advanced towards her. She could feel the male’s form in front of her. Energy pulsed from the figure, scents of snow and ice-ivy, of frost and mountain pine filled her nose. And immediately, Felix drew deathly still. A</p> <p>81</p> <p>single thought flooded every cell within her body; high alertness tightened her exhausted muscles. . . Winterian. Venom laced her whisper, “Unbind me Now Winterian filth.” Felix had expected a blow or some form of aggression to be thrown back instead the same low infuriating chuckle that responded. Felix threw herself against her bonds, rough rope bit into her wrists and ankles. Her arms strained, pulling harder against the twisted twine. She managed to haul part of her restraints loose when a large firm hand took hold of her arms. “I said, Stop that Now.” Pin pricks of ice spread from where his flesh met hers, and she wanted nothing more than to throw him off, but his grip remained firm and unbreakable. Felix grit her teeth, further ignoring the pain radiating from her cracked jaw. She would not sit idly by and be humiliated. Suddenly energy of strange magic flooded from a low whisper in a dialect centuries-old sifted into her ears and senses. Felix’s limbs dropped against her. Her legs were leaden as if the air itself around her held her down. A hiss leapt from her throat, magic. Felix drew to respond, she dug deep within her waiting to feel the familiar sparks in her blood but, nothing. She pulled again, and then it all slammed back into her. She could feel her face drain of color. The ancient one, its enchantment, pain unlike any other; grief and longing only dredged up in response to her call. Her flame was gone; she was facing a Winterian powerless. Something within her slumped under the foreign magic’s embrace, and 82</p> <p>this time, she heard similar whispers as the crushing force lifted. It didn’t matter, she could not fight, the flame which had been her eternal companion was ripped from her. Felix did not move; she sat stilled and waited. Felix wondered with self-loathing hot in her cheeks, what must her father possibly think if he knew Autumn’s sole heir had lost her flame, was powerless and at the mercy of their sworn enemy. Perhaps if he were still alive, he would find someone to take her place in that as well. A new better heir. Cold despair weighed her stomach down like a stone. The Winterian in front of her hadn’t moved he still there, likely crouched in front of her. He was watching her, waiting for her to flail and struggle once again; she could feel his eyes. Much to what Felix assumed was the Winterian’s disappointment; she was done struggling; she was just done. The room around them had turned silent, and still, he watched her. After another long moment when he was sure she wasn’t going to fight anymore, a low whisper again filtered into Felix’s ears. The same foreign lilt carrying enchantment, but this time, there was no magic touch onto her skin, but slowly light filled her vision. The blackness she’d become accustomed to shed away like a snake’s skin. Felix blinked rapidly, trying to get her sight adjusted to the practically blinding low light. Silver eyes stared deep into her own, and for a moment, Felix’s breath left her; as soon as the eyes appeared, they were gone. She blinked, and the form that had been in front of her disappeared. “Magic,” Felix grimaced bitterly. She twisted, trying to see if the silver eyes were anywhere to be found, but the room was empty. Giving up on finding the silver-eyed Winterian Felix searched her 83</p> <p>surroundings, it surprised her how much she relished sight. Firelight was spread across the bare wood walls of whatever fort or encampment she was in. For a moment, she almost considered calling to the</p> <p><a href="desertflame-18.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-20.html">next</a></p>
