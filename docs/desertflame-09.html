<body><p>orange cape drape down the stairs behind his back. His heavy riding boots left a slow sinking echo. A stone weighed down her stomach. She was stuck caged and alone. *** The aroma of cooked pork glazed in sweet sauce, wine, fresh fruit, pumpkin, and spice, filled her nostrils and Felix’s stomach flipped excitedly at the thought. Since her delightful time with Anollen, she realized she never got breakfast nor any food for that matter. Fresh bread, smoke roasted meat, squash, and caramelized vegetables, Fruit from the southern orchard, hard, dense ale, and mead, along with the heady tang of her Mother’s favorite wine all called to her as she silently made her way down the cobblestone hallways. Towards where food beckoned. The table was at least seventeen feet long. The large roast pig sat in the center, shining in the 39</p> <p>swaths of torchlight. It was by far the most appealing sight in the room much fairer than the table’s gaudy occupants. Her father sat at the head, his wife to his left, and his Commander (her replacement) on his right. Her seat. The Commander was broad and lean. His build was that of strength but also agility, a good choice, but his eyes were all she needed to know that he was unfit. In all her brooding Felix had wondered if perhaps Hedion would take her place, he was by far the wisest choose, or at the very least one of her other generals, but no. Felix bit her cheek to keep from showing the smirk she felt inside. She stepped out from behind her corner, and immediately, the table grew quiet. Her father’s eyes lightened, but as she met his gaze and then he saw what she wore. Felix’s uniform and leathers had at least been cleaned since her scruff in the woods but they were no where near the finery glittering around the table. Thiradin’s eyes dimmed, and his lips turned down in a firm line, but he said nothing. Felix’s mother , however, scowled her eyes narrowing albeit the amusement reflected in her muddy irises. Some of the pettier nobility sitting farther down the table looked at Felix, their mouths agape. Felix stared at the royal feast and its participants; her eyes stopped at her replacement. He wasn’t staring at her in surprise nor disappointment like the others oh no, he was staring at her with something else. His pupils dilated, and she watched as he looked at her figure up and down, stopping just above her middle to her… breasts. Lust. Revulsion rolled over every inch of her. She sent him a cold glare, but of course, he missed that he was too busy undressing her with his eyes. Her fists balled, and adrenaline began to flood through her. The prick was practically 40</p> <p>asking for it. “Felix, either sit and join us or go back and put on something more appropriate for meals.” A serpent’s smile slithered onto her lips perhaps the one trait she’d learned from mummy dearest. Felix’s eyes opened wide, almost as if she was going to gently apologize, but just before she spoke, her face sharpened into a sneer. “No, I think I’d rather stand here, thank you. And father, if I’m dressed inappropriately why are, you dressed the same?” If the nobility looked shocked before they were astounded now, even for progeny, it was rare to ever speak back to a High Lord in such a manner, much less to do so in front of the company. Felix dared him, her eyes holding the threat her lips desperately wanted to spell out. “Say it; I dare you. Say what you actually mean, wear something appropriate for a woman.” Unlike before, Thiradin wouldn’t hold her glare. “Pitiful and weak,” she thought. Her insides burned with unsatisfied anger, conflicted with longing, and heartbreak. “Let me out. Let me show them who you are” somewhere deep in her heart, a smooth voice whispered. “I don’t see why she cannot wear the leathers, Lord, after all, I’m sure Lady Felix is just having trouble adjusting to her new lifestyle”</p> <p>41</p> <p>Commander Elryan’s voice was silky smooth, and his eyes never stopped memorizing her figure. He wasn’t defending her, not in any way that counted. He was belittling her, had painted her as a pouting child. She desperately wanted a piece of the lean young man in front of her. Maybe leave a mark on his pretty face. Silent and glaring, Felix took the only open seat at the table . . . the one just beside the cocky prick himself. Elryan, at many points from then on, seemed to find convenient was for their hands to bush each other or for his leg to “slip” and trace her own. Repulsive. He was nothing like the men she trained with, he was overconfident and a prick. Felix had to continually gulp down the mead and water placed before her to keep herself from gagging at the table. If Elryan had any real power in the Court on any other given day, Felix might’ve been tempted to use him to her advantage. But, the only value in Elryan’s company was that he might indeed give her an excuse to leave dinner. . . by making her physically ill. Thiradin gave a loud clap, and quiet waiting feet entered. Slaves poured into the great hall. They went in and out through the corridor to the kitchen fetching more food and drink signaling the meal had begun. The slaves’s black garb and Red collars easy to spot in the light. Prisoners and or the descendants who were left alive to serve those merciful enough to take them in. Winterian. A girl a few years younger than Felix stepped in with a platter of cheeses and even more fine bread, it smelled divine. Her eyes were downcast, and she didn’t dare try to speak. She moved quickly trying to avoid any trouble, each slave was given two marks if they caused more than two incidents they were resold, or in some cases sent to the front lines as free casualties. Felix noted the</p> <p>42</p> <p>females features. This girl was definitely Winterian. Her pale skin and dark brown hair gave her away. The girl was small, gaunt and her black tunic hung loosely. Small scars crisscrossed her fingers and hands from deep burns and Felix’s eyes widened. Magic this girl had elemental magic. . . it was amazing she was even permitted to live. It was a blight to let a Winterians keep their natural magic. Those with</p> <p><a href="desertflame-08.html">previous</a> <a href="desertflame-10.html">next</a></p>
