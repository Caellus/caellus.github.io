Hi! My name is Ben, and I'm an occasional game dev and enjoyer of roguelikes, currently learning Godot and working on a wave function collapse algorithm for texture generation (which I'm planning on talking about soon). Some of my favorite games (in no particular order) are:

- [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
- [Brogue](https://sites.google.com/site/broguegame/)
- [Bad North](https://www.badnorth.com/)
- [Sunless seas](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless/)
- [Noita](https://noitagame.com/)
- [TABG](https://landfall.se/totally-accurate-battlegrounds)
- [Streets of Rogue](https://streetsofrogue.com/)
- [Mandagon](https://blindsky.itch.io/mandagon)
