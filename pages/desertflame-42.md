edge of his mind. He was restless, something was stirring. More reports had
come of breaches in the Haize. Things were changing.
Thallan showly wiped the layers of sleep from his face and looked down
beside him at his sleeping companion.
Kaerynn often made a habbit of slipping in beside him during the dead of
night. Neither male were particularly overt when it came to their time together,
often wordless comfortable communication hung between them. Thallan reached
out a gentle hand and brushed aside a wayward raven lock from Rynn’s face.
Thallan thought for a moment about when he and the male beside him
had first reached for the company of one another. They had both been young,
barely breached the age of manhood, Thallan rembered the day when things
changed, when their comfort beside eachother had grown to something more.
Over the years both him and Kaerynn had taken different lovers and
partners but in their times between they found one another. Some female, some
male. The connection between them had changed and evolved through the
centuries. Thallan smiled softly to himself. Kaerynn always found a way to him,
his friend understood his need for solitude and quiet, Rynn knew if Thallan’s
door was locked to leave him be, and if it wasn’t that he was welcome.
Kaerynn began to stir sensing Thallan’s alert mind and feeling his lover’s

”It’s alright, go. I understand. Find me if you need to”
Thallan nodded, once again thankful his companion needed no more
explaination then that. Slowly he rose his body letting the soft blankets to slip
from his bare form as he padded towards his dresser to pick the attire he needed.
Kaerynn sat up from the bed and watched him quietly, still adjusting from
the depths of sleep, his green eyes warmed as he watched Thallan and offered a
him small smile. There were no words needed, there never were. It wasn’t the
kind of love that wrote and unwrote the fabric of time, nor that sung in woes of
song, it was that of silent easy comfort and that was enough, it had been for all
the centuries they’d known one another.
Once he was dressed Thallan quickly left the manor allowing himself to
be pulled towards his thoughts.
It wasn’t uncommon for the Highlord to venture out during night hours
but no matter how he moved Thallan couldn’t ware off his etching weariness.
Eventually he settled just sitting atop the large stone steps to his Manor and left a
hand atop Jasper’s stone head.
The night was calm and around him Thallan tuned his instincts, he could
feel life surrounding him, the small woodland creatures stirring, and the large
guarding trees huddled in his mountains swaying to gentle winds.
Without even realizing it a bit of Thallan’s magic thrust to life and
suddenly the jackal beneath his palm rustled to life.
Felix

Apparenlty a night of ”entertaining” themselves to Daen meant a
particularly debaucherous game of cards all of which to Felix’s surprise the near
silent Kaerynn won in spades.
Their games had run into the wee hours of the night and so Felix was
shocked when she was reawoken to daylight still hours away. An exhausted
groan slipped out as she raised her hands to rub at her droopy eyelids. For
mother’s sake she was tired.
Felix left herself a mental note to never challenege Catalyia to a drinking
game again as the world continued to tilt here and there as she sat up.
Satin silk-soft sheets pooled around Felix’s hips as she stretched letting
her bare skin feel the comfortable warm room air, only the smallest hint of
Winter’s chill. The room around her was serene, the manor itself seemingly
slumbering. Just the barest amount of moonlight bloomed from the window and
felix turned to watch the small twinkling flakes of snow.
Outside the window flurries of and wind gently knocked against the glass.
The stars and moon hung glistening across the violet dark sky, an easy breath
grew beneath her breast as Felix looked out. So incredibly beautiful. She’d be
loathed to ever admit it but the fozen wastes it seemed held their own beauty
without any hint of flames.
How could a land of brutes, monsters and those who would see to it her
kin lay slain, how could it still look so enchanting?
Even if she knew it to all be a farce, a facade they kept high, Felix could
not blink away her own wonder.

Just as the Autumnarian heir prepared to turn and once again surrender to
the depths of slumber, movement shifted in the edge of her gaze.
At first Felix couldn’t make out what she was seeing, then as the figures
drew closer towards the center of her window she froze.
Just a small ways off from her window’s frosted glass beneath a
moonlight-dappled canopy, Thallan stood. His tunic was rumpled and his dark
hair still held out at odd ends suggesting the male had recently risen from bed.
Felix’s eyes scanned him, taking in his form.
Her eyes traced along the sharpened path of his jaw, noting the shadows
of scruff, she traced it to the long strong cords in his neck leading to broadened
shoulders, despite his unusually unkempt attire, the male was still striking. Even
beneath the tunic Felix could spot the strong form she’d fought, she remembered
the feeling of those muscles beneath her hands, the steelness under her fists and
the iron of his grip when he had held her still.
Felix’s gaze continued downward as heat traveled under her skin,
unknown to her, unbidden the sudden urge to trace those strong lines with her
fingers or even perhaps her tongue swept through her. Gods it had been too long
since she had felt the heat of intimate company. Felix’s cheeks glaized over in a
light blush and molten fire began to burn low in her core right as her eyes grew to
the band of Thallan’s briches and lower...
Before her heated gaze could make it any further, a sudden rush of bronze
rushed before her. Felix’s pulse raced as a large menacing metalic jackal rushed
forward and lept onto the male Faerie’s back, its ruby eyes glinting.
