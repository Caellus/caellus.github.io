## Chapter XVIII
*Thallan* 

Thallan had thrust himself out of sleep, hearing the gentle wake at the edge of his mind. He was restless, something was stirring. More reports had come of breaches in the Haize. Things were changing.

Thallan showly wiped the layers of sleep from his face and looked down beside him at his sleeping companion.

Kaerynn often made a habbit of slipping in beside him during the dead of night. Neither male were particularly overt when it came to their time together, often wordless comfortable communication hung between them. 

Thallan reached out a gentle hand and brushed aside a wayward raven lock from Rynn’s face.
Thallan thought for a moment about when he and the male beside him had first reached for the company of one another. They had both been young, barely breached the age of manhood, Thallan rembered the day when things
changed, when their comfort beside eachother had grown to something more.

Over the years both him and Kaerynn had taken different lovers and partners but in their times between they found one another. Some female, some male. The connection between them had changed and evolved through the
centuries. 

Thallan smiled softly to himself. Kaerynn always found a way to him, his friend understood his need for solitude and quiet, Rynn knew if Thallan’s door was locked to leave him be, and if it wasn’t that he was welcome.

Kaerynn began to stir sensing Thallan’s alert mind and feeling his lover’s gentle carress.

”It’s alright, go. I understand. Find me if you need to”

Thallan nodded, once again thankful his companion needed no more explaination then that. Slowly he rose his body letting the soft blankets to slip from his bare form as he padded towards his dresser to pick the attire he needed.

Kaerynn sat up from the bed and watched him quietly, still adjusting from the depths of sleep, his green eyes warmed as he watched Thallan and offered a him small smile. There were no words needed, there never were. It wasn’t the kind of love that wrote and unwrote the fabric of time, nor that sung in woes of
song, it was that of silent easy comfort and that was enough, it had been for all the centuries they’d known one another.

Once he was dressed Thallan quickly left the manor allowing himself to be pulled towards his thoughts.

It wasn’t uncommon for the Highlord to venture out during night hours but no matter how he moved Thallan couldn’t ware off his etching weariness. Eventually he settled just sitting atop the large stone steps to his Manor and left a hand atop Jasper’s stone head.

The night was calm and around him Thallan tuned his instincts, he could feel life surrounding him, the small woodland creatures stirring, and the large guarding trees huddled in his mountains swaying to gentle winds.
Without even realizing it a bit of Thallan’s magic thrust to life and suddenly the jackal beneath his palm rustled to life.

*Felix* 

Apparenlty a night of ”entertaining” themselves to Daen meant a particularly debaucherous game of cards all of which to Felix’s surprise the near silent Kaerynn won in spades.

Their games had run into the wee hours of the night and so Felix was shocked when she was reawoken to daylight still hours away. An exhausted groan slipped out as she raised her hands to rub at her droopy eyelids. For the Mother’s sake she was tired.

Felix left herself a mental note to never challenege Catalyia to a drinking game again as the world continued to tilt here and there as she sat up.

Satin silk-soft sheets pooled around Felix’s hips as she stretched letting her bare skin feel the comfortable warm room air, only the smallest hint of Winter’s chill. The room around her was serene, the manor itself seemingly slumbering. 

Just the barest amount of moonlight bloomed from the window and Felix turned to watch the small twinkling flakes of snow.

Outside the window flurries of and wind gently knocked against the glass. The stars and moon hung glistening across the violet dark sky, an easy breath grew beneath her breast as Felix looked out. So incredibly beautiful. She’d be
loathed to ever admit it but the fozen wastes it seemed held their own beauty without any hint of flames.

How could a land of brutes, monsters and those who would see to it her
kin lay slain, how could it still look so enchanting?

Even if she knew it to all be a farce, a facade they kept high, Felix could
not blink away her own wonder.

Just as the Autumnarian heir prepared to turn and once again surrender to the depths of slumber, movement shifted in the edge of her gaze.

At first Felix couldn’t make out what she was seeing, then as the figures drew closer towards the center of her window she froze.

Just a small ways off from her window’s frosted glass beneath a moonlight-dappled canopy, Thallan stood. His tunic was rumpled and his dark hair still held out at odd ends suggesting the male had recently risen from bed.

Felix’s eyes scanned him, taking in his form.
Her eyes traced along the sharpened path of his jaw, noting the shadows of scruff, she traced it to the long strong cords in his neck leading to broadened shoulders, despite his unusually unkempt attire, the male was still striking. 

Even beneath the tunic Felix could spot the strong form she’d fought, she remembered
the feeling of those muscles beneath her hands, the steelness under her fists and
the iron of his grip when he had held her still.

Felix’s gaze continued downward as heat traveled under her skin, unknown to her, unbidden the sudden urge to trace those strong lines with her fingers or even perhaps her tongue swept through her. Gods it had been too long since she had felt the heat of intimate company. 

Felix’s cheeks glaized over in a light blush and molten fire began to burn low in her core right as her eyes grew to the band of Thallan’s briches and lower...

Before her heated gaze could make it any further, a sudden rush of bronze rushed before her. Felix’s pulse raced as a large menacing metalic jackal rushed forward and lept onto the male Faerie’s back, its ruby eyes glinting.

”Aspen”

The name hung in the air still and Felix could only gape as Thallan rather than yell out in alarm only proceeded to release a quiet laugh and ducked his shoulders low hoisting his canine attacker into the air and dumping it into a powdery patch of snow.

Aspen sprung up with effortless agility and while his attention was caught on her, Jasper bound forward and launched at Thallan. The three forms rustled in the snow both Jackals keeping the male on his toes and for the first time since she’d met the brooding Fae, a true smile brushed at the tips of his lips.

Once her shock receeded, Felix’s awe at the living metal beasts swept through her. She had never seen their like before, there was no doubt the creatures rough housing with her captor were the very same statued at the front
of the Manor. Her mind dug for any essence of what might allow such a thing, but in all her albiet dreary teachings as a child she’d never heard not witnessed such magic. 

Myth had claimed once Winter had been closed off from the Haize bits of the Court’s and Limeare’s magic had sifted through the land allowing for strange magic and enchantments to form, Felix had always brushed such a thing
off as rumor and hear-say and yet befre her very eyes horse playing in the snow,
was the miraculous.

Felix continued to watch the three tumble about until the earliest rays of dawn blinked near the mountain peaks and her eyelids grew heavy. Eventually Thallan too seemed to sense the coming morning and began his trek back to the Manor entrance. Felix lifted her drowsy form from the windowsill and crawled
back into the warm welcoming bed. Daen would likely search for her soon and bring about whatever her next task was, but he could wait for a few more hours likely gripe about it later, but for now she would sleep.
