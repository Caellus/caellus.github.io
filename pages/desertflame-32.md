Fae were said to have achieved as a myth told by admirers. Now, she instead
could only certify its truth. The woman’s movements were silent, and where
Felix’s own people resembled the speed and spark of the wildfire, and the
Winterians seemed to move with impossible feline agility to ally their cold, this
woman was the picture of fluid adaptation.
It was like watching ripples shimmer across the surface of a calm lake
only for this woman; the world was almost incorporeal as she moved through it.
Felix could not help but be in awe like so many wide-eyed traders she’s seen at
the port when they rehashed their journey to her court’s elusive neighbor.
“I am indeed of Spring, Felix.”
The woman’s effortless beauty was stunning the straying rays of the sun.
Her voice was gentle, and somehow the lighter cadence reminded Felix of the
twinkling whisper from the crystal creeks in the forests near her camp. T
he people of Spring truly were the last remnants of the nymphs long
forgotten to time. Felix was so caught up in this tranquil creature she forgot her
own confusion as to how she knew her name. Only the those present during the
market would have known who she was. Felix eyed the woman again, this time
under a more suspicious gaze. Surely she couldn’t be intertwined with the
Winterian High Lord?
The people of Spring, while more passive in their motives and beliefs,
had shown no sort of sympathy nor allegiance towards their Winterian
counterparts, and yet Felix could not for the life of her gather how else she would
have known her name. Felix wracked her thoughts into a confounding loop until
she finally relented and asked
132

“What are you doing here? How did you get here? Have they taken you
as well?”
Urgency colored her voice as frustration thickened in her throat. The
beauty didn’t look captured, and Felix’s question seemed to give her visitor
pause a few feet away. The women’s smooth, soft features became contemplative
as she watched Felix, debating something. Then something seemed to clear, and
she opened her mouth in reply keeping the intrigued amused smile on her face.
“I believe I likely got here the same as you, I crossed the border. To
answer your first question, I am here at the behest of my Court, which I must
add, Heir of Sevael, you are not.”
Felix’s jaw felt as if it had unhinged itself, dropping unceremoniously to
the floor. Though she had given the Winterians her first name, she never once had
revealed the true identity of her lineage. Even with the now roaring hearth and
bright sunlight, Felix wrapped her arms around her best she could with her
bindings.
Anger flushed through her cheeks, and she bared her teeth as again, her
thoughts whirled, and she tried to ascertain how this woman could possibly know
her. Her father rarely came into contact with Spring High-fae, which Felix had
no doubt this woman was and Lady Aquin had left spring centuries before Felix
was even born. So how could she have known? Felix had never met her, she
would’ve remembered such a face.
The Spring Faerie watched her and sensed her thoughts chuckling,
“Word from your Court must first come through my borders before they

133

can reach here, with the Haize in place I serve as a conduit and emissary of sorts
I suppose to Winter and its new Queen from my High Lady.”
The woman continued smiling almost at Felix’s shock,
”Count on my surprise when I was sent here to deliver the news that the
infamous Autumnarian Flame and Heir was missing under the guise of a traitor.
Of course, then I am further assaulted with news as Winter has been ’blessed’
with a new visitor as well. One of unprecedented stubbornness and fighters
strength. And both carry the same name and pattern of ruthlessness.”
She chuckled once more thoroughly, enjoying this.
“Don’t worry Autumn Heir, your lineage is known only to me fore, while
Winter may be my ally I don’t believe I would want to be responsible for what
were to happen to you had my allies known exactly who fell into their laps. So,
for now, no conclusions should be drawn that Felix the border guard is the same
Fire-breathing hellion who is set to one day lead the Court responsible for these
people’s bloodshed.”
Without realizing, Felix’s mouth was flooded with the taste of iron as she
clamped down upon her tongue as fear and rage battled inside her. This woman
was keeping her secret, keeping her life in the balance.
“Now that that’s been covered, I am simply here, Felix, to see to your
wound. I suspect, given your upbringing, you are familiar with the Ranks of
Aeilyth?”
The more the woman chose to speak, the further confusion and awe
pulled at Felix’s senses. Saliva pooled one the base of her tongue as she stared
134

dumbly at the Lady of Spring.
The Ranks of Aeilyth were known across all of Tehlaeya. They were
Spring’s most eloquent and powerful healers, many said to be the most beautiful
creatures to walk the Faerie realm. Many High Fae families of nobility, as well as
High Court families such as Felix’s own, would send their own physicians to
train under the order, Anollen for almost a century had stayed and learned inside
the Spring borders before returning home. Even with all of Anollen’s renown, as
she watched her visitor step closer, Felix gathered that what he knew and had
learned had barely scratched the surface of a true sister under Aeilyth.
As Felix continued to stare, she recalled another whispering she had once
heard about the sisters while also being gifted healers those among the Spring
High Court were said to serve more than one singular purpose. Under the High
Lady or Lord of Spring, the Ranks of Aeilyth were seen as advisors to their
thrones. Some sisters of Aeilyth were whispered to be some of the best assassins
in the world, with illusions and sorcery passed down from the water and nature
they thrive on. But Felix always dismissed it as sailor’s folklore.
At first, when she had come closer to Felix, gooseflesh broke out on
Felix’s skin, and nerves paraded inside her. Could this woman be one such
legendary protector? The fierce intelligence sparkling in her eye made Felix
believe it was definitely possible. In the deeper recesses of her memory, Felix
recalled a rumor she’s heard port sailors and soldiers whisper,
