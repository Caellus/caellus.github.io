Thallan’s chest seized as all the pressure in the room vaulted. His Queen.
Felix had threatened his queen. Everything in the male screamed at him to
intervene, to put the Autumnarian down. Yet even as every hair on his body stood
and small incisions of claws sprouted at his knuckles, Thallan felt the invisible
ties of his Queen’s magic holding him at bay.
“Easy, Aeilre is fine. Back down now”
The soothing tone of Kaerynn’s voice hummed in Thallan’s ear as his
body slowly responded. Thallan’s steely gaze met Felix’s, even immobile she
remained haughty, hatred blaring at the surface and yet he could sense her awe
too. Whether she wanted to admit it or not, the Autumnarian could sense there
was no farce, Aeilre held within her veins the true power of the Monarch. The
rising queen of Winter held equal right to the throne of the courts and Limeare
willing Thallan would see her put there.
Taking a slow breath out, the Winterian Queen began to release her hold
over the room and their captive. Even without the magic’s thrall Felix remained
motionless, stunned no doubt. Thallan had expected the female to launch as soon
as she was once again able but instead he watched as she scanned each of them,
assessing. Felix’s bonds had once again tightened making any shift beyond the
bed next to impossible, but Thallan didn’t believe for a second that that was what
had kept the spritely female still, no even with all her rage, she took command
and understood it would do no good.

“Well then, that will be enough of that. While I understand your adversity
towards me I will not have you threaten me in my own domain”
Aeilre’s voice thrummed strong and regal, a tone she so rarely chose over
her gentle lilt but all in the room could not help but to listen. Felix’s spine
snapped to attention even as her teeth ground hard enough Thallan almost
thought he heard them. As the tension continued to dissipate he could barely
keep himself from smiling as Felix dipped back onto the bed reminiscent of a
pouting child.
“Thallan,”
His eyes met Aeilre’s and at her expression he knew it an instant
whatever she was going to say next, he would not like.
“You found this Autumnarian at our borders, have fought and assessed
her ability, so I’ve heard. Therefore I leave her in you and yours, care. She will
overshadow your lieutenants in their duties and should she wish, train”
Mother bleeding light he hated being right. As if baring his same
sentiment an indignant cry left Felix’s lips. At least someone else too would have
to deal with his Queen’s stubborn nature, there would be no changing her mind
now that it had set.
“Well just like that friends it looks like we’ve been demoted down to
babysitters”
Daen’s chuckle woke the others from their shocked stupor. Catalyia
rolled her eyes and Ithira grimaced, and Kaerynn ever the settled stone merely
met Thallan’s gaze probing his silent question. “Are you alright?”

Thallan bit back a small growl in response, no by the Mother no he was
not. The Autumnarian had brought nothing but chaos to his Court and his
delightful Queen had just called for the more the merrier.
“It won’t be that bad”
Yes yes it would. Thallan shook his head, turning away from Ryn he
instead watched Aeilre, waiting until she gave a small nod and moved to walk
past him back towards the hall. Silently the High lord of Winter left to follow his
monarch and left his lieutenants to watch over Felix.

Felix
Mother of Light it was fucking cold. Wind swept her auburn hair into her
numb face as she glared at the grinning devil dragging her behind him. And as no
surprise to anyone, Daen offered to take the first shift with Felix unwillingly
tagging along.
Their path ladened with snow and ice was marked by large uneven
boulders as they approached the base of a mountain. Gods they better not have to
climb that. Felix’s gut squelched in warning and her feet cried out from the
already bitter-chilled torment. Daen it seemed was in no such dismay has he
whistled holding onto Felix’s silken bonds. Although her bindings had loosened
to remain comfortable and albeit warm considering the bleak frosty wind, Felix
wanted them off.
Somewhere along their journey the grey-soup sky had broken out into a
flurry of small flaked snow and Felix peaked out her tongue to brush one of the
falling dusts. The sweet cold tinged along her nerves and although she shivered
she had to stop herself from doing it again. It was odd, not altogether unpleasant
though. When she caught Daen watching and smirking at her Felix quickly
righted herself and puckered her mouth tightly even as her cheeks warmed.
”No need for that, I’d venture a guess it’s your first snow? None of that
harsh hale you get on your side of the border”
Daen lifted an eyebrow at Felix satisfjed when she gave a small shy nod
in response.
”The first snow is something to celebrate, no one here will blame you for

155

your curiousity”
As if to demonstrate Daen poked out a blossom-colored tongue and let
one of the dainty white flecks float into his mouth. The male was strange, strong
and he could have been intimidating if he wished and yet, he seemed currently
more like a small child. He was trying to lessen her discomfort. Odd.
Odd. That was the best word to describe this whole place Felix
determined. Back home Felix remembered plenty of tales surrounding the
miserable frozen court. As far as she could tell, only small escence of what her
people believed reflected what she had to witness, course that could simply be
what they chose to show her.
Felix narrowed her eyes at her swaggering babysitter. There wasn’t a way
she was going to get past him, enoguh observation combined with her lack of
magic told her as much, but for now she could just bide her time. Felix often was
one to much prefer up front tactics and fighting, swiftness behind the scenes she
left more so to her Courts spies, but for now she could do her best to emulate
