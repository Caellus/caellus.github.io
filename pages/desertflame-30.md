title: Deserters Flame

Two brushed-silver sconces held unlit torches, which undoubtedly wouldn make the whole room glow come the night. A little to the other side of the door from the bed was a large cobblestone fireplace with a heavenly warm hearth blazing. 

Scooting a bit farther up, Felix could make out a thick layered midnight blue carpet covering most of the hardwood floor. And lastly, above the fireplace mantle mounted a brilliant longsword encrusted in a single sizable sapphire at the pommel. Situated just above the blade hung a turquoise and icy blue banister showing once again the proud form of Winter’s crest the great Frost Leopard a
shiver went down Felix’s spine as she gazed over its vicious snarling features.

Wherever she was being held, she would need to be on her guard. Felix took in the room now instead realizing what it meant being housed
in her enemy’s home. She could not let herself be swayed by the tranquil beauty of the space she needed to escape, to free herself. Then somehow she’d find a way back home.
She needed to find out if her father was still alive; then she’d go back and face what she’d done. A stone plummeted in her stomach as she swallowed the rising tide of anguish and anxiety thought of her father brought.

“What? The room not good enough for your liking Sparky?.”

Felix all but jumped she’d forgotten about her audience having remained silent the whole time. Felix’s face heated, and annoyance reared along her tongue, readying her retort when another deeper voice from the doorway cut her off.

“Come off it Catalyia, leave the Autumnarian be. She’s been harassed by you enough for one day.”

The male voice was light-hearted and teasing, very different than the cooler bored tone of the male who had beaten her. Felix scanned the doorway as a new face she faintly recognized him from the dais the night before appeared a
broad grin on his smug handsome face.

The male was tall like Silver Eyes, though perhaps a little shorter, and his build was more warrior-built muscular while the Silver’s was lean and feline, predatory. For Light’s sake she needed to know these people’s names!

His hair had the slightest curl of tousled maple-brown locks that shagged around the nape of his neck. Rather than wear fine robes, Felix would expect from a High Faerie, the male worse similar fighting garb to that of a soldier. Hooked onto either side of the male’s belt were two magnificent onyx colored
falcatas, each catching rays of the sun from the windows. The blades shown layers of folded elegant steel, the dark metal seemed to even seep in staying light from the near windows. Even the from a distance, Felix could appreciate the craftsmanship and deadly grace of the two sloping swords.

“See anything you like?”

Felix’s eyes immediately jumped from the male’s belt area back to his smug face. His cocoa-brown eyes sparkled mirth, and Felix growled lowly. He was the same sarcastic male from the night before, the one she’d almost fought before. The one Silver Eyes interrupted.

Oh, how Felix wished she could have fought this male. He did not seem any less capable than her previous opponent nor did Felix truly believe she would’ve gotten a different result; she just wished she’d gotten the chance to pound his pretty face into the ground.

“No need to growl m’lady, after all, we’ve only just been introduced.”

Pausing as if to ponder his next words the male purred

“Though I suppose I should give you my name since I know yours,” 

He gave a sweeping, dramatic bow and proceeded,

“I am Daen. Pleasure to meet you, Sparky, or rather Felix.”

Violet eyes or Catalyia, still stood in the room and rolled her eyes at Daen’s antics. Felix couldn’t help but chuckle quietly.
Upon hearing it Daen’s face broke out into a further victorious grin. The sarcastic male had a light dancing in his eyes that suggested even in the midst of battle he remained jovial. The was just a tint of madness reflecting in that light.

Oddly enough he put her simultaneously at ease and off balance. And she almost enjoyed it. Had it been under any other circumstances Felix almost wondered if perhaps in him she’d find a kindred spirit.

After a few more back and forths between Felix and her two High Fae babysitters, Felix finally earned some privacy and spent much of it staring up at the blank cream ceiling, thinking back to herself of moments of home. 

What would she be doing now if she were back home? Training alongside Hedion and the men? Felix closed her eyes, and she was back in the barracks.

The smell of iron and smiths filled her nose. She was surrounded by familiar oak walls and her small window leading out to the valley below, holding the small border villages. Felix could see Dawn rising and felt herself fall back in-line, she hurried into her battle leathers and strapped on her swords and
daggers. 

Cold brisk air carrying the smallest warmth of weeks prior nipped at Felix’s face as she rushed through the barracks occasionally jostling other late soldiers so she could make it out to the command fields. Of course, as leading rank she could have taken her leisure, it was within her right to make her men
wait but, she had never believed it necessary that the commander be treated any different from her men so long as her orders were followed. 

To the Nobles’ astonishment Felix Eliean Sevael heir to the Autumnarian throne and Commander of the Autumnarian Guard, ruthlessly attended the same grueling drills, training cycles and fought side by side with her nation’s foot soldiers and dined side by side with Captains rather than dignitaries and wealthy nobility.

Hedion was waiting for her on the field as she ran out. Some of the men in line nodded to her while others chuckled at her scattered appearance. 

Felix steeled her resolve as she turned to face each of them; blades strapped at their
hips or to their backs leathers and plate armor guarding their bodies as they stared straight forwards, waiting for her orders. 

Shoulders back Felix called out each drill maneuver, and as a single organism, the unit moved together.

Pride swelled in Felix’s mind as she looked over her soldiers, her men, peers, and friends. Where her blood kin stood in jeweled palaces, her real family was here beside the battlefield. Felix caught Hedion’s eye as he watched her. His eyes intent and burning of all the things she wished yet knew he’d never say.
