He’d seen something felt something. Fleeting brilliant flares of blinding white
light beside the barrier. When the light had flashed every nerve in his body had
been set on edge.
Unconsciously his breaths seemed to get faster and shallower the closer
he came to the to whatever called him. The light had long since gone out but, he
could still feel the thrum of ancient magic in his blood. Like an old song with a
hushed tune and odd whispers in his ears, it seemed to draw him in. It wasn’t
until he came to a crescent clearing between deep pines that he saw what it was.
The tall strong
Oak surrounded the area as if they were its guardians.
What stuck Thallan as odd was the tall oak did not grow in Winter lands.
The air too harsh and frigid for the gentle strong giants to grow and the soil too
frozen and often covered in unforgiving ice for the long gnarled roots to get a
strong footing. He had never seen these trees before and yet there they stood
taller than all the rest of the foliage in all there might which would’ve taken
centuries to grow. The magic around him seemed to pause its hum now silenced
like the world itself came to a stop.

It was then that Thallan noticed the figure in the center of the strange
trees. And his beating heart in his chest stopped. His eyes fully found hers and
his breath was gone in an instant.
She stood tall with hair that fell to her waist. She was adorned in the
purest white. Flowers were braided into her hair and then there were her eyes.
Gold. But not like the coin or even the shine of a flame, her eyes shown with the
bright gold of the sun that rises each morning above the High Peaks. Ethereal, no
other word could come even close to describe her. She didn’t move, merely
watching him, even with a small smile gracing her delicate features. Warmth that
shouldn’t be in his court emanated from her and at once Thallan knew who stood
before him. Instantly he was bowing his head. She made no sound but she
stepped closer. Mother Light stood before Thallan and her whole form seemed to
glow faintly. With his head bowed it was then that Thallan finally spotted what
was behind her. In the center of the trees lay another figure. This one was not
glowing. His eyes quickly skimmed over the second figure, a female, she was
unconscious as far as he could tell, his sharp ears could just make out her ragged
slight breaths. She was crumpled onto the frosted forest floor and Thallan
couldn’t help but breathe in deeply attempting to place her odd scent.
Warm white fingers took hold of Thallan’s chin and he met the Light’s
golden gaze once again striking any inquires out of his mind. She spoke no
words but turned for a second to look back at the fallen faerie behind her. With
one hand the Light touched his chest and then swept it toward the faerie. Magic
deep and ancient again tugged at his senses and this time it soaked into him. The
taste of spices and brittle parchment, of fire, and warmth coated over his tongue.
The tang of iron, of hearth and embers swept into his nose and her scent he’d
77

previously tried to place was suddenly everywhere. It was so strong he almost
fell back as his eyes widened just a touch.
Before he could breathe out a word Mother Light seemed to nod and then
closing her gentle eyes vanished.
All that remained were the strange large giants growing above his head
and the female sprawled out before him in the cold. Like stirring from a dream
the forest around him began to rustle and wake. The wind howled in the trees and
sent a chill down to the clearing. The icy blast came against Thallan’s skin and it
felt like a fresh new breath inside his lungs. The wind and ice, this was the forest
he knew, his home. But, Thallan’s relief from the familiar chill was cut short
when the unconscious figure in front of him shuddered. Her skin was an almost
pale blue color and her body shook from the frost.
Thallan stepped hesitantly closer as he let his gaze draw nearer his chest
squeezed, in the darkness, he had not seen her clearly. But his eyes now scanned
every inch of her unconscious slight frame until it felt as if ice was threading into
his blood. His hands curled into fists as he stared directly toward the liquid flame
strands of hair splayed around her tanned features, and all at once her
unmistakable scent tugged one singular thought blasting above the blood roaring
in his ears . . . Autumnarian

Felix
Something was howling. And cold. It was loud against her, ears, her
skull, much much too loud.
Her eyes struggled to breach the all-encompassing darkness refusing to
recede. Felix wanted to shout at whoever had left the window open and let the
blasted chill in, but she couldn’t move. The howling continued as breezes
wracked against her skin. Again Felix prepared to bark at whatever imbecile to
shut the window and let her resume her desperate sleep, but as she opened her
mouth, only a slight whine released from her hoarse throat. Dizziness shook her
as she attempted any movement, and it was at the moment after her mind decided
barking at idiots was not an option did she realize she was already moving.
Steady firm thumps shook her frame as airlessness soon became ground
over and over. Nausea, a familiar friend at this point, roiled in her stomach,
calling for an end to the intermittent thumping. Slowly other senses began to
settle in around her, although the infernal darkness still remained as her eyes
seemed forced to shut. Her ears prickled as warm blooms of air blew against her
. . . was that breathing? The shallow gasps of air she was barely able to push
down into her lungs all but stopped in anticipation as she began to realize
something was breathing. Flashes of the dark cavern and violet scales replayed in
her mind, and worry thrummed up her throat, yet this breathing was different.
Faster. More labored.
Felix stilled or tried to as much as she could possibly be managed when
constantly bouncing with each thump against the ground. She tried to block out
the howling wind and infernal thumping of what must have been footfalls and
79

instead tried to glean anything else possible from her surroundings. It would be
much easier to do so if her eyes would just open! She thought bitterly.
Despite her best efforts ignoring the wind remained increasingly difficult
as each gust whipped icily against her poorly covered skin. It was too blasted
cold to think, why in Light’s name was it so cold? Shivers wracked up and down
her body and frustration at the continued lack of vision was eating at her insides.
