### Hi :3 
My name is Cat, (she/her/they/ them). I am from the Bay Area however go to school on the East Coast. 

I'm  not an occasional game dev and *enjoyer* of roguelikes, that said I am a writer, avid reader, student and in general just a relatively loud personality. 

I enjoy various areas of curiosity whether it be science and reasoning or some wild various fantasy. I am currently a Chemistry major and an English minor. 

Some other things you should know are simply I am not a techie person, I am good with books, and with people and often math but not computers so this site is primarily based on what I have learned from others, meaning if it's buggy, my appologies ... maybe I know how to fix it? XD 

[[Here's]](https://github.com/Caellus/caellus.github.io) the source code for this site
