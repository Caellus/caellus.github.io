*They did not seek war, only the promise that destruction should follow if their enemy dared provoke them. It had been blistering as the ice hit her face and limbs, making her feel still and heavy, deep bone-chilling cold. They hit a sentry watchtower and sparked a small spate with the meager amount of Winterian fighters that answered their call.*

*At the time, she had scoffed at how few they had kept to watch, their arrogance astounding. That was when the frozen bastard had hit her. She’d felt his magic and ice splaying down her back. She had feared he would tear her wings apart* 

*Pain latched onto her cold and like nothing she’d ever felt, then blinding rage took command* 

*Before the male could more inflict damage onto her men, she took him out. He barely had the chance to tell out warning before she tore through them all* *

Winterian magic users were forbidden by the Courts ages ago. 

Though, as Felix left her memories, she realized: Court laws likely didn’t matter to any of these people anymore. She was following her duty.

“The village was attacked, it wasn’t a military installment?” 

Felix felt her voice drop some as she uttered the question. Her female captor eyed her.

“That’s what you’d love to assume, wouldn’t you, to justify your people’s bloodshed? And no, it was hardly a small hamlet, farmers, and countrymen. Unlike your people, we don’t seek out a fight so often, so there’s little use for
border soldiers.”

Felix grit her teeth, and her hands balled into fists.

“High and mighty coming from a rebel who’s own people just declared war on mine”

The Winterian maiden remained silent though her eyes shot daggers. She pulled Felix forward, further ignoring the celebration and heading for a set of large oak doors. As they drew closer, Felix rethought the Winterians words,though they were the aggressors in the war had she made the wrong call?

Turmoil, like a foul stomach cramp, bore down on her, but she concealed her face
with masked indifference. The giant stone doors opened as strong guards lifted the wards and pulled them aside. 

Past the celebratory hall, Felix found what could almost be an open
market of sorts. The ceiling and walls were tall like that of the hall prior, and floating lanterns twinkled overhead, keeping all the proceedings in enough light.

As the passed, she marveled at the stalls of food, clothing, and jewels that would have her mother salivating on sight. Takers called out their wears; it seemed like nothing could end the hustle and bustle of all the people gathered. The business, although chaotic, rumbled on-heartily, reverberating through the halls like a grandfather’s laugh striking up a warmth of hearth and home to all regardless of
the merciless cold beyond the walls.

“Where do you possibly get so much food? Your Court is isolated?” 
The thought remained more to herself than to her silent companion. Her eyes watched as small children ran through the crowds, many holding little sticky pastries or hard rock candies that only were brought out for nobles back home. 

Felix hated to admit it, but the market was beautiful, not at all starving or barren as she had believed all parts of Winterian life to be. The beasts of this court that she’d read
about in the pages of her studies had evidently stayed there. Only a thing on pages of fairy tales or at least they certainly weren’t the people who passed her
by with barely a glance.

The market then fell swiftly behind them as they reached another large set of stone doors though these held numerous guards. The captain seemed to nod at her captor. Felix watched the two pausing. Her thoughts whirled, So the
slight female held some station at least among these males. 

It had taken Felix years to grant such acknowledgment among her men back home. Silently she cataloged that fact into her mind as she was rushed off towards the third set of looming doors. The last set swept open quickly, and Felix and the small female were ushered in as the doors closed behind them. 

The final chamber was only slightly smaller then it’s prior counterparts. Like the two others, it held beautiful molding and character, carved images of battles and warfare lined the walls like epics of ages long before.

Oddly enough towards the mid-center, Felix found one familiar story depicted in all court halls, the epic of Esperanza and Gabrielle, The Courts' triumph and . . . Winter’s fall.

Felix stared at the devastating beauty in the mural, magic brought the piece to life, almost as if for one moment you were brought back to the times of old of the Court’s alliance and the battle which ended the eternal ice age. But
why would they depict their fall, moreover why was it the same as she had been taught? Would they not seek to shine themselves in a better light in their own art?

Felix’s gaze traveled over many more mosaics and murals before her breath caught. On one side of the chamber, she came face to face with a sparkling tapestry, lilac, and amethyst stands shined scales, and pearlescent white threats shone almost as true and the fangs she had just glimpsed in the cavernous pit
below her father’s palace. Onto the wall hung a golden tapestry shining none other than the dragon from her nightmares since her encounter. The fire-stealer.

Spider-crawling nerves peppered throughout her body as if the beast were truly there and it meant to finish the job it had started. She could almost feel it’s eyes watching hers. Felix continued staring until commotion caught her eye and she refocused on the rest of the room. 

It was quieter then the previous halls. The majority of its occupants gathered in half-moon circle facing a stage where to her horror Felix watched as men and women alike stood on stage brought on and led off in chains. 

Where the market before had beauty, here was nothing but the ugliness Felix had always
believed she would find behind the cracks. This was a slave market, and her captor’s earlier jibes hit her true to their mark as her heart shuddered in her chest.

She was here to be sold.
