Felix picked up speed as the wind began to whistle in her ears. Beneath
her weight, FireFly bolted as if it were nothing at all. Hedion on his own stallion
kept up close behind her. Each hoof beat thundered into the damp forest floor,
and all animal life seemed to stop and just watch the magnificent steeds. It wasn’t
long before Felix heard their shouts and the sharp twang of arrows releasing from
crossbows. The clearing came up fast, and Felix steadied herself and watched.
There were eight lords within the company. Each man was atop one fine
prancing steed or another. All of them . . . except Lord Davern. The Lord of East
Mount seemingly thrown from atop his mount was stuck in the mud his sword
drawn but poorly held in his shaky sweaty palm. A sizable pale ghoul in rags of
deep grey and brown loomed over the stout man. A large frost hound circled
Davern’s whinnying mare whose back leg already bitten seemed to have resulted
in a limp. Hedion stopped beside her, and although his face was drawn into a
frown he remarked dryly “I think they’ve got this, I say we just sit and watch the
show.” The corner of his mouth quirked into a small smile. Felix ignored his
comment but, couldn’t hide her own half-smirk. The lords each fired their
crossbows, but somehow, no arrows even came close to hitting either the ghoul or
the hound. Felix dismounted and unsheathed her blade from the scabbard at her
hip. “Ready?” Hedion rolled his eyes to the heavens but then too dismounted.
The scene was chaos in every sense. Felix had to duck as soon as she entered the
clearing from a stray arrow that impaled itself into an oak behind her.
“Cease Fire Now!” The courtiers shifted and faced her. Some of their
faces were shocked, others were relieved. Davern, even from his sprawled out
position, managed the audacity to look offended. He opened his mouth, huffing,
and puffing and hollered. “Are you mad? Don’t stop firing! The beasts aren’t

dead!” Hedion stepped into the clearing and shouted back,
“Your men are more likely to take down one another before you ever hit
either one of the monsters. Put. Your. Weapons. Down.”
Though Davern’s face turned a delightful shade of purple, there was no
further argument.
The courtiers backed towards the edge of the clearing as Felix advanced
on the ghoul. It had turned to face her, and disgusted shivers ran down her back.
The beast’s pale skin was drooping down from milk-white bones its flesh
practically translucent. What she could only assume was its mouth opened and
released a high pitched screech that would have her ears ringing for days.
Without giving it the time to react, Felix swept forward, launching her body into
the creature. It was cold and reeked of something foul and rotten beneath the
packed soil. Gritting her teeth, she parried the thing’s claws with her sword and
reached down to her boot fishing for her small dagger. The light but strong, sharp
blade hummed in her hand as heat crawled out from her blood, Felix kept her
eyes on the beast as she felt her magic digging deep within her and fire pulsed
into her hand. The blade glowed orange just as she thrust it firmly into its side.
Claws of ice and rotten leaves alike struck towards her, and as she shifted to
avoid them, they scratched over her left side, and a sting like a thousand needles
threatened to release a scream from her throat. Even still, she didn’t let up, and in
her mind, she cursed the creature and hoped it rotted in whatever despot it came
from. She swung the red-hot dagger twice more until the blade finally hit its
mark. The beast’s heart was cold and hard as stone, and the moment her
blistering steel met it, the heart shattered, and the ghoul fell away.

Felix’s chest heaved, and her side still stung, but it wasn’t nearly as bad
as before. She turned around to wide eyes from the gathered pretentious lords.
Next to them, Hedion snickered, enjoying the scene. Felix gave her Second a
slight nod, then turned back to the snarling hound. The beast bared its teeth and
slowly backed away from her, it ears flattened back against its head and fur
upright in agitation.
“What are you waiting for? Kill It!”
There was an audible squeak to Davern’s voice as Hedion did his best to
move the pompous bag of potatoes further away from the scene. “Don’t you ever
shut up?” Hedion grumped, and Felix could feel her lips curve. The hound let out
a dark growl, but its eyes watched her wearily. Felix stepped closer until the pup
stopped moving. Somewhere in her mind, she remembered it was generally
unwise to approach a cornered animal, but had someone reminded her of that fact
then, she would have shrugged. As she drew nearer, behind the raised fur on the
hound’s scruff, Felix saw something. Without hesitating, she thrust forward, and
her blade again lashed out, hitting its mark precisely. A small whine left the
pup’s mouth as it fell. Felix watched as the ghoul stone collar smashed into the
earth. The hound let out a startled yip and quickly turned tail and vanished
between the trees. Behind her, Davern gurgled his protest, but she paid him no
mind; the beast was free now. It wouldn’t harm them. It could go where it
wished. Without further protest Felix and Hedion lead the drooping lords back to
the village border before the standard courtier guard resumed their posts
guarding their marks. Felix pitied whoever was stuck guarding Davern. As she
and Hedion broke off from the entourage and towards the barracks, Hedion let
out a short laugh.

“Davern practically pissed himself when he watched you fillet that
ghoul.” She cracked a smile. “That said, you know that hound is going to
terrorize the local growers, right?” Felix shrugged “That’s their issue, and you
remember after the barricade mission at Aldivea they-” “They declined to give us
food and shelter over their lands, and our forces barely made it through the
hunger during the siege days. I remember, But you also know they only did that
because the year prior, you burned all their fields barren in order to subdue the
Kaleas tribes.” “It was the optimal strategic move, you know that” “Yes, I knew
that, but they didn’t know that you gave them no warning nor explanation.”
Felix shrugged, and Hedion let out a long tired sigh and rolled his eyes.
Just as the pair approached the soldier’s barracks, both preparing to hop
off the saddle, the clatter of hooves had Felix pause. A messenger clad in his red
and gold uniform raced towards them, and the rider hollered. “Commander,
you’ve been summoned.” Felix groaned. “Yeah, I got that given that you’re here.”
Her response may have been snide, but the messengers were always rude to her,
they like her, were sick of just how frequently she was “summoned.” “It’s your
Father, he calls for your attendance immediately.” A low huff pushed past her lips
