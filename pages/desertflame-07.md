A battle of wills shined between their eyes. Her throat tightened, and her
vision blurred for a minute. Why was her vision blurring? She would not show
weakness here. Her father’s scorn hit something deep inside. She wasn’t the son
he needed to have a strong bloodline. She wasn’t even of a pure bloodline. 

She was female, a bastard born of his mistress. She would be nothing in the Court if he had a child of the pure, noble bloodline. He never told her she wasn’t enough, but behind the strain in his eyes and the tension on his shoulders, Felix could see it, could feel it even if he tried to hide it. He needed an heir, a true Male heir.

Thiradin’s face morphed to that hewn from steel. Her eyes left the floor,
and she met his gaze, causing her stomach to dropped. He was cold, gone was
whatever hope she had of reaching him.

“I have given you my order. I am your Lord; you will do as I command.”

“You’re also my Father.”

She wouldn’t let them, any of them see her crack; she was the heir to the
throne bastard or not; she would not usher any tears like a whimpering maiden.
Her eyes stung the forbidden emotion swelling inside despite her. Yet one last
look at her Father and she shoved it away. If he could be cold, she would be
colder. The Lord’s fierce gaze softened for a fraction into a warm, comforting,
and sorrowful smile.

“Yes, I am your father, and as such, I must protect you even if it isn’t
what you want. So my order remains the same as both Lord and Father. Felix,
You will learn your place here, and eventually, you will grow to accept it.”

“Now, Guards take Lady Felix to her chambers and see to it she stays
there.”

Felix couldn’t hear the rest of her father’s words she drowned them out
and didn’t even struggle when the cold metal gauntlets on each Guard’s hands
grasped her arms and tugged her away from the Court. 

Just before passing through the side doors she turned she looked up and there her Father’s sad eyes met her own and he broke his gaze. He couldn’t keep looking at her. 

Beside him, a cruel serpentine grin spread over her mother’s face; finally, Isabella’s wild daughter would be tamed.
