he needed to have a strong bloodline. She wasn’t even of a pure bloodline. She
30

was female, a bastard born of his mistress. She would be nothing in the Court if
he had a child of the pure, noble bloodline. He never told her she wasn’t enough,
but behind the strain in his eyes and the tension on his shoulders, Felix could see
it, could feel it even if he tried to hide it. He needed an heir, a true Male heir.
Thiradin’s face morphed to that hewn from steel. Her eyes left the floor,
and she met his gaze, causing her stomach to dropped. He was cold, gone was
whatever hope she had of reaching him.
“I have given you my order. I am your Lord; you will do as I command.”
“you’re also my Father.”
She wouldn’t let them, any of them see her crack; she was the heir to the
throne bastard or not; she would not usher any tears like a whimpering maiden.
Her eyes stung the forbidden emotion swelling inside despite her. Yet one last
look at her Father and she shoved it away. If he could be cold, she would be
colder. The Lord’s fierce gaze softened for a fraction into a warm, comforting,
and sorrowful smile.
“Yes, I am your father, and as such, I must protect you even if it isn’t
what you want. So my order remains the same as both Lord and Father. Felix,
You will learn your place here, and eventually, you will grow to accept it.”
“Now, Guards take Lady Felix to her chambers and see to it she stays
there.”
Felix couldn’t hear the rest of her father’s words she drowned them out
and didn’t even struggle when the cold metal gauntlets on each Guard’s hands
grasped her arms and tugged her away from the Court. Just before passing
31

through the side doors she turned she looked up and there her Father’s sad eyes
met her own and he broke his gaze. He couldn’t keep looking at her. Beside him,
a cruel serpentine grin spread over her mother’s face; finally, Isabella’s wild
daughter would be tamed.

Chapter IV
Felix
Anollen had again been summoned to check Felix’s wounds and redress
the bandages littering her back. Though he was already not looking forward to
the encounter with the “fire-breathing hag” as he called her, he wasn’t adequately
prepared for what he saw when the chamber door opened. Anollen gaped at the
faerie before him. Felix was lying quiet and resting peacefully upon her bed
when around her, the steaming ashes of dolls and beautiful sheets and linen
smoldered. The picture didn’t fit, the room looked as if it had been hit by a small
inferno, but there Felix was, looking nothing but quiet and contemplative. Her
normal spit-fire less than a simmer, only a silent shell remained in its place while
the room around her burned.
Anollen dared to enter the war zone and cautiously approached her.
“Felix, I have come to check your wounds.” Felix didn’t move; she made no
motion to stir, didn’t even look at him as if he wasn’t there at all.
Anollen’s throat dried, and he swallowed nervously; she was quieter than
he’d ever seen her, and that wasn’t a comfort. Felix’s calm pensive nature further
beckoned for some unseen shoe to drop or more like explode.
“Ah, my delightful healer. Did you know My father wishes to make me a
Lady?”
Bitterness was present in her tone, but all expression had drained from
her features. Anollen took another step forward, watching almost waiting for her

33

to pounce, but when she didn’t react, his tensed muscles released somewhat. He
was tempted to roll his eyes. Of course, she was being dramatic. Anollen had
always wondered why the High Lord had given his female heir such leniency in
the first place. He was relieved she would finally be leashed, taking on her real
role no longer gallivanting off, leaving destruction in her wake. Wordlessly the
old man trudged over to her bed and opened his small satchel that hung from
across his shoulder.
The gash on Felix’s back had already shown signs of small improvement,
and the stitches had held through her previous struggling. Anollen reached and
felt her warm skin and noticed the coolness of the injury. His face etched in
concern.
“Does the cut still hurt highness?”
Felix’s nose scrunched at the title, but she knew that he didn’t like calling
her it any more than she enjoyed hearing it. Felix shook her head. Anollen’s
eyebrows drew together; she was lying.
He had raised the girl since she was a babe, and she was always too
stubborn and prideful to admit anything hurt. His hands slid down her back and
pressed lightly on the surrounding skin neighboring her wound. He traced the ice
blue web spreading outward from the gash and suddenly pressed down hard.

Felix
Felix’s breathing hitched, and her teeth latched onto her lip to suppress a
scream, a hiss escaped from between her teeth. Pain crawled all over her back
34

like thousands of spiders sticking into her. As if someone had lit a match to her
flesh, and the burning icy pain ignited her skin. Tears pricked at the corners of
her vision as she groaned.
“Liar. Your father was right to remove you from command. The barracks
are no place for the likes of you.”
“Shut it.”
She could barely rasp the words out as her muscles tensed. The pain
slowly subsided as Anollen released the pressure on her injury. She let out slow
breaths, and the webbing pain released her inflamed nerves. “In case it wasn’t
clear, that’s not normal or good Highness. Your injury is healing on the outside,
but whatever that barbarian hit you with carried something into your
bloodstream. If I can’t counteract whatever they hit you with Felix, it may end up
doing what the Winterian couldn’t do in person. End what they started.”
It seemed as if the room had significantly chilled. For a moment, the
Winterian soldier was suddenly upon her once again. Felix has always meddled
