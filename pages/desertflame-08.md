with danger and recklessness, but somehow, the thought of death had never truly
reached her. It was a cruel wake-up call. She couldn’t die, she wasn’t ready, an
unknown chill crept over her. Fear. She was afraid to die. Preposterous, warriors
fell along battlefields every day, and yet“Your father is protecting you. With your stubborn and stupid nature, I’m
surprised he hadn’t restricted you sooner.”
Anollen made no effort to use bedside manner. The lass was too
thick-skulled to see her own mistakes, so he’d chosen a more bristled realistic

35

approach, and considering there was no love lost for Felix, he wasn’t inclined to
be kind. Felix didn’t say a word after that. Anollen quickly cleansed her
remaining wounds and reapplied to the bandages, but neither spoke.
Finally, having finished his duties Anollen left without so much as a
goodbye only a reminder to keep the stitches in place. He was glad to be rid of
the vengeful impulsive faerie, she was trouble. She was going to get herself
killed; while this troubled him only a little, his true fear was what that would
mean for his Court. Felix meanwhile didn’t move from her bed. She continued to
look absently at her ceiling. How had she gotten into such a mess? It was like
suddenly everyone lost their sense. She wasn’t a Lady, nor would she ever be.
The life of playing the pianoforte and looking after little ones, supporting a male
with soft words would never ever be her life. Her father, her mother, and the
Winterian they were to blame if he hadn’t left the damn cut she wouldn’t be in
this mess.
Sourness filled her mouth as she thought of her father’s command. She
would push him; he had to see she wasn’t meant to be caged. He had to see
reason. Her lips scowled, and she knew she would have to fight an uphill battle.
Her father’s words rang loud in her ears from years before. “Eyes open, alert,
keep your stance steady, and Felix, most of all, always be ready if you need to
adapt and never let your fear consume you, but don’t forget it either. A warrior
achieves balance.”
Now it seemed her father neither wanted her to be a warrior or to be
anything but a man’s pretty little helpless object. Bile rose in her throat. Men.
They were grotesque; they only wanted to satisfy either what they could see from

36

their eyes or what they could use between their legs.
The only men who had any worth were the Sentry Guard. Physically
perfect, formidable, smart, and dominant. They weren’t men; they were males,
unlike the courtiers who couldn’t handle a bar brawl much less a battlefield.
Autumnarian Guard showed no mercy, nor any hesitation, they were perfect
defenders. Hedion flashed in her mind spreading heat through Felix to her core.
She envisioned him beside her, leading all of the soldiers she so often fought
alongside. They were honored, but no matter their greatness, they would never be
of equal rank to a a royal heir.
Felix’s thoughts shifted remembering the far off look on her Second’s
face whenever he believed she wasn’t looking. Hedion had known this would
come. Had known she could never last to be a soldier. He’d seen ahead to what
she had so naively chosen to dismiss. Her mother would get to choose some lazy
court bastard who would lay about his throne and she forced to do so beside him.
And he’d expect her open and spread for his every need.
“Felix?”
Felix shook her head, waking her from her thoughts. A small knock
reverberated off of the old oak doors. It was rare to hear her father’s voice so
quiet, almost hesitant like he was afraid to awaken a stirring beast, and in this
case, he wasn’t wrong. Even the thought of Lord Thiradin’s face drew another
batch of heated rage into her chest. No, she would not back down and play nice;
she had nothing to say to him.
He knocked again, but she didn’t move from her bed; she wouldn’t fall
for his fatherly affection, not now when he had brutally abandoned her. He had
37

sent her to her mother; a wolf inside faerie skin.
“Felix . . . I know what I said angered you. I know you may very well
hate me for it, but I cannot lose you . . . You are my daughter, the sole heir, and I
cannot and will not risk that even if it means pushing you away. Please try to
understand I only want you safe.”
That was enough; she couldn’t stand it any longer he was trying to defend
himself? How dare he! He knew exactly what he was doing; he was abandoning
her, forcing her into a different person like stuffing a newly shedded snake back
into some old unfamiliar skin.
Felix marched to the door and swung it with so much force it rebounded
against the wall and left a loud resounding Thwack!
The two of them were silent and staring at each other. Her father’s eyes
so much like hers, no longer held the light of anger or fear; instead, they held no
light at all. Suddenly the dark circles gathering beneath his eyes became
apparent, and the extra wrinkles in brow seemed more pronounced than before.
For the first time in her life, Felix stared at her father, and instead of the fiery,
passionate warrior she’d known, she saw a weary man, a Lord whose decisions
over the centuries had slowly pulled at his life force, tiring him. He looked sorry
. . . not guilty but genuinely remorseful for what he knew he was pushing her
towards.
“You say you don’t want to lose me, but if you do this, if you force me to
become this, keep me from what I love, you’ll lose me for sure, and I won’t ever
come back. You want me to be some stupid oaf’s wife. I will never be someone
else’s prize.”

Her father had no counter-argument, no response. His shoulders felt
heavier than ever, and pain ebbed in his chest. His stiff hardened fingers brushed
her cheek, and he looked directly into her now watery gaze. Her lips parted in a
silent plea to stop. For it all to be a dream, but her father’s gaze was sobering any
hope she had; slowly draining her own light. He reached forward and left a
feather-light kiss above her brow. Then the ever-burning High Lord of Autumn
turned and left her standing there in the doorway. Left her to watch his receding
figure leave her behind.
For all her tries to brush everything else away to let nothing touch her, no
matter how many walls she brought close to her heart, nothing could have
protected her against the heartache growing, an empty void as she watched his
