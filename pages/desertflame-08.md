## Chapter IV

*Felix* 

Anollen had again been summoned to check Felix’s wounds and redress
the bandages littering her back. Though he was already not looking forward to
the encounter with the “fire-breathing hag” as he called her, he wasn’t adequately prepared for what he saw when the chamber door opened. Anollen gaped at the faerie before him. 

Felix was lying quiet and resting peacefully upon her bed when around her, the steaming ashes of dolls and beautiful sheets and linen smoldered. The picture didn’t fit, the room looked as if it had been hit by a small
inferno, but there Felix was, looking nothing but quiet and contemplative. Her
normal spit-fire less than a simmer, only a silent shell remained in its place while the room around her burned.

Anollen dared to enter the war zone and cautiously approached her.

“Felix, I have come to check your wounds.” 

Felix didn’t move; she made no motion to stir, didn’t even look at him as if he wasn’t there at all.

Anollen’s throat dried, and he swallowed nervously; she was quieter than
he’d ever seen her, and that wasn’t a comfort. Felix’s calm pensive nature further beckoned for some unseen shoe to drop or more like explode.

“Ah, my delightful healer. Did you know My father wishes to make me a
Lady?”

Bitterness was present in her tone, but all expression had drained from
her features. Anollen took another step forward, watching almost waiting for her
to pounce, but when she didn’t react, his tensed muscles released somewhat. 

He was tempted to roll his eyes. Of course, she was being dramatic. Anollen had
always wondered why the High Lord had given his female heir such leniency in
the first place. He was relieved she would finally be leashed, taking on her real role no longer gallivanting off, leaving destruction in her wake. Wordlessly the old man trudged over to her bed and opened his small satchel that hung from across his shoulder.

The gash on Felix’s back had already shown signs of small improvement,
and the stitches had held through her previous struggling. Anollen reached and
felt her warm skin and noticed the coolness of the injury. His face etched in
concern.

“Does the cut still hurt highness?”

Felix’s nose scrunched at the title, but she knew that he didn’t like calling
her it any more than she enjoyed hearing it. Felix shook her head. Anollen’s
eyebrows drew together; she was lying.

He had raised the girl since she was a babe, and she was always too
stubborn and prideful to admit anything hurt. His hands slid down her back and
pressed lightly on the surrounding skin neighboring her wound. He traced the ice
blue web spreading outward from the gash and suddenly pressed down hard.

*Felix* 

Felix’s breathing hitched, and her teeth latched onto her lip to suppress a
scream, a hiss escaped from between her teeth. Pain crawled all over her back
like thousands of spiders sticking into her. As if someone had lit a match to her flesh, and the burning icy pain ignited her skin. Tears pricked at the corners of her vision as she groaned.

“Liar. Your father was right to remove you from command. The barracks
are no place for the likes of you.”

“Shut it.”

She could barely rasp the words out as her muscles tensed. The pain
slowly subsided as Anollen released the pressure on her injury. She let out slow
breaths, and the webbing pain released her inflamed nerves. 

“In case it wasn’t clear, that’s not normal or good Highness. Your injury is healing on the outside, but whatever that barbarian hit you with carried something into your bloodstream. If I can’t counteract whatever they hit you with Felix, it may end up doing what the Winterian couldn’t do in person. End what they started.”

It seemed as if the room had significantly chilled. For a moment, the
Winterian soldier was suddenly upon her once again. Felix has always meddled
with danger and recklessness, but somehow, the thought of death had never truly
reached her. It was a cruel wake-up call. She couldn’t die, she wasn’t ready, an
unknown chill crept over her. Fear. She was afraid to die. Preposterous, warriors fell along battlefields every day, and yet

“Your father is protecting you. With your stubborn and stupid nature, I’m
surprised he hadn’t restricted you sooner.”

Anollen made no effort to use bedside manner. The lass was too
thick-skulled to see her own mistakes, so he’d chosen a more bristled realistic approach, and considering there was no love lost for Felix, he wasn’t inclined to be kind. 

Felix didn’t say a word after that. Anollen quickly cleansed her
remaining wounds and reapplied to the bandages, but neither spoke.

Finally, having finished his duties Anollen left without so much as a
goodbye only a reminder to keep the stitches in place. He was glad to be rid of
the vengeful impulsive faerie, she was trouble. She was going to get herself
killed; while this troubled him only a little, his true fear was what that would
mean for his Court. 

Felix meanwhile didn’t move from her bed. She continued to
look absently at her ceiling. How had she gotten into such a mess? It was like
suddenly everyone lost their sense. She wasn’t a Lady, nor would she ever be.
The life of playing the pianoforte and looking after little ones, supporting a male with soft words would never ever be her life. Her father, her mother, and the Winterian they were to blame if he hadn’t left the damn cut she wouldn’t be in this mess.

Sourness filled her mouth as she thought of her father’s command. She
would push him; he had to see she wasn’t meant to be caged. He had to see
reason. Her lips scowled, and she knew she would have to fight an uphill battle.
Her father’s words rang loud in her ears from years before. 

“Eyes open, alert, keep your stance steady, and Felix, most of all, always be ready if you need to adapt and never let your fear consume you, but don’t forget it either. A warrior achieves balance.”

Now it seemed her father neither wanted her to be a warrior or to be
anything but a man’s pretty little helpless object. Bile rose in her throat. Men. They were grotesque; they only wanted to satisfy either what they could see from their eyes or what they could use between their legs.

The only men who had any worth were the Sentry Guard. Physically
perfect, formidable, smart, and dominant. They weren’t men; they were males,
unlike the courtiers who couldn’t handle a bar brawl much less a battlefield.

Autumnarian Guard showed no mercy, nor any hesitation, they were perfect
defenders. Hedion flashed in her mind spreading heat through Felix to her core.
She envisioned him beside her, leading all of the soldiers she so often fought
alongside. They were honored, but no matter their greatness, they would never be
of equal rank to a a royal heir.

Felix’s thoughts shifted remembering the far off look on her Second’s
face whenever he believed she wasn’t looking. 

Hedion had known this would
come. Had known she could never last to be a soldier. He’d seen ahead to what
she had so naively chosen to dismiss. Her mother would get to choose some lazy
court bastard who would lay about his throne and she forced to do so beside him.
And he’d expect her open and spread for his every need.

“Felix?”

Felix shook her head, waking her from her thoughts. A small knock
reverberated off of the old oak doors. It was rare to hear her father’s voice so
quiet, almost hesitant like he was afraid to awaken a stirring beast, and in this case, he wasn’t wrong. Even the thought of Lord Thiradin’s face drew another batch of heated rage into her chest. No, she would not back down and play nice; she had nothing to say to him.

He knocked again, but she didn’t move from her bed; she wouldn’t fall
for his fatherly affection, not now when he had brutally abandoned her. He had sent her to her mother; a wolf inside faerie skin.

“Felix . . . I know what I said angered you. I know you may very well
hate me for it, but I cannot lose you . . . You are my daughter, the sole heir, and I cannot and will not risk that even if it means pushing you away. Please try to understand I only want you safe.”

That was enough; she couldn’t stand it any longer he was trying to defend
himself? How dare he! He knew exactly what he was doing; he was abandoning
her, forcing her into a different person like stuffing a newly shedded snake back into some old unfamiliar skin.

Felix marched to the door and swung it with so much force it rebounded
against the wall and left a loud resounding Thwack!
The two of them were silent and staring at each other. Her father’s eyes
so much like hers, no longer held the light of anger or fear; instead, they held no light at all. Suddenly the dark circles gathering beneath his eyes became apparent, and the extra wrinkles in brow seemed more pronounced than before.

For the first time in her life, Felix stared at her father, and instead of the fiery, passionate warrior she’d known, she saw a weary man, a Lord whose decisions over the centuries had slowly pulled at his life force, tiring him. He looked sorry . . . not guilty but genuinely remorseful for what he knew he was pushing her towards.

“You say you don’t want to lose me, but if you do this, if you force me to
become this, keep me from what I love, you’ll lose me for sure, and I won’t ever
come back. You want me to be some stupid oaf’s wife. I will never be someone
else’s prize.”
