laid before him. The Mountain’s edge allowed him to see most of his Court
nestled into the magnificent peaks, and under mornings light, the snow glittering.
As he took in the stunning beauty, a warning called out in his mind, and
suddenly he lurched upright. He’d left his manor the meeting with his
lieutenants, the Autumnarian captive, all of it flashed back to the forefront of his
mind as all fog of sleep receded. Shit.
It took all of one moment to pass as Thallan stood that he realized his
form lay utterly bare. Not an item of clothing in sight. Curses fluidly flew from
Thallan’s mind as he moved downwards back towards his manor. As he walked,
he tried to pull at his magic, only to feel it drained completely and unreachable.
He had used all of his magic when he was pulled out of the enthralling Wind.
The last dregs of his power had been used to wake him from the his heavy
slumber. Drained, aching, and tired, the Winterian High lord trudged back
towards his Manor now freshly covered in the past evening’s snowfall. Thallan
stilled, and his pointed ears pricked as he listened. He drew his senses towards
his home, hoping to hear the blissful silence or possibly light wisps of his
Manor’s magic, but his shoulders slumped upon a hearty laugh that had likely
come from Daen echoed through his home’s walls. Shit.
The briefest of hopes that his lieutenants had left, impatient of waiting
disintegrated. Thallan knew as soon as he opened the door, he’d have to face the

music. Heaving a sigh, he approached his heavy doors guarding his sanctuary.
On each side of the doors lay his two proud bronze and steel jackals. Ruby and
Topaz eyes gleaming. Each alert and ready, even as statues. Thallan reached out
a hand and touched a cold bronze ear, rubbing it affectionally silently thanking
the house’s guardians as they perched forever, staring down, waiting for
intruders. Warmth from the hearth as well as the lightest breeze of music reached
him as he thrust open the firm doors.
He padded down the hall, trying to remain unnoticed, but no sooner than
he had crept over the threshold, did the slinking form of a lunar-white wolf poked
out from the shadows. Ithira’s white coat glossily shimmered beneath the sun’s
rays streaming through the main hall’s vast windows. One blue eye and one
brown glared into him, and for a moment, the wolf bared her teeth. Thallan
glared back and eventually rolled his eyes. Before his eyes in a brief flash, the
wolf before him flawlessly shifted into the lean form of Ithira, the fourth member
of his inner court.
“Feeling anti-social again, Ithira? Shame”
The Faerie female made a slow unimpressed glance at Thallan’s bare
stature and flicked a loose lock white of hair out of her eyes, Any other male
would have felt a blow at her show of apathy towards his masculine form. But
Thallan merely shrugged undeterred. He knew she only had eyes for her mate.
“No more anti-social than you, I see. We’ve been waiting all night. Daen
threatened to go out and find your sorry ass. Of course, he settled down but still”
Ithira’s features remained a stoic mask of unforgiving ice, and Thallan
gave a small bow in acknowledgment. He shouldn’t have let himself grow so far
117

gone. Should not have been gone so long.
“and the captive? Is she stable?”
Thallan searched Ithira’s cold etched features when a feminine voice rang
from further down the hall as Catalyia appeared.
“She’s with Issarael now, and she’s contained well for now, though when
she wakes, she won’t be too pleased about it.”
Thallan nodded, and Catalyia shifted closer to Ithira’s side. Although the
change was almost imperceptible, Thallan caught the moment Winter’s White
Wolf softened towards her mate. Her stance eased ever so slightly, and a light
flickered deep in each of her eyes as she wrapped an arm around Catalyia’s
shoulders.
Thallan admired the two opposites where Ithira was tall, and lean
Catalyia was slight and curvy. While the white wolf was mostly stoic and silent,
Catalyia was never so contained.
Heavier sets of footsteps filtered down towards them until they paused.
While still far down enough that Thallan couldn’t distinguish them from around
the hall’s bend, he heard a cough hiding a slight chuckle unmistakably Kaerynn
while once again Daen’s hearty laugh pounded towards them.
“Well, now we can all guess why the High Lord of Winter didn’t grace us
with his presence last night”
Daen’s sarcasm brought more giggles from Catalyia and a slight smirk
from her stoic mate.

“Did fighting off the Autumnarian get you too hot and bothered
Highness? Needed to let off a little steam there, Thallan? Can’t say I blame you”
Thallan shook his head, sighing once more as both final members of his
inner court came fully into view.
“Nothing like that Daen, I was out last night and needed to shift. All of
you know shifting can sometimes drain enough so that our outer garments are ...
unretrievable.”
“True if you’re an untrained pup.”
Catalyia snorted, and Thallan again wished he were alone. He trusted his
lieutenants implicitly and their council was invaluable, but like with any family,
their incessant prying nature was also exhausting.
Ithira was right he was feeling antisocial.
“Deal with Felix when she wakes up. I want to know how she got that
Frost Burn and who she is. And for Limeare’s sake try and keep her contained
this time.”
Thallan barked out the order with undue harshness, but none of his inner
court were phased, most just smirked or nodded.
“Sure thing Highness.”
Daen joked and turned back towards the great room of the Manor, Ithira,
and Catalyia arm in arm in toe.
Only Kaerynn remained paused, staring at Thallan, and as the High Lord
clenched his jaw stiffening, he knew his friend was reading him, searching and
119

seeing right through him.
“It happened again, didn’t it? That’s why you were gone last night. It
