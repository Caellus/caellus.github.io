cell and stinking chamber pot could’ve easily been arranged. I must alas confess
Autumnarian you give far too much credit to our scheming ways, the drapes
before you are just that, drapes and water, only that to quench thirst.”
Felix sat silently her eyes glowering and sharp canines ever so slightly
bared. This wench was bearing down on her patience and hot embarrassment
colored the tips of her ears. The woman indeed did seem earnest despite Felix’s
trained caution. The room did only seem like a warm dwelling and Felix didn’t
need to sniff to tell the water was clean. Despite all that, she wouldn’t lower her
guard, being caught a fool was not an option.
“I’ll take it you don’t want water then”
“No”
Releasing an amused sigh the female put down her raised water pitcher
on a nearby table. Felix waited for her to move to leave, but the Winterian simply
sat at a waiting seat beside the bed and looked out toward the window. Neither
woman spoke, and Felix again took the time to study her new intruder.
She was not like the others. Unlike the two babysitters before who had
baited Felix, this woman was not built like a warrior. Her frame held a delicate
languid demeanor and her features were gentle, softer than that of someone
trained on area fields. She was more slight than Felix, though the two were of
similar height. This woman despite her lack of muscle or warrior’s poise, held

148

her head high. She spoke with enough prowess Felix found it hard to believe her
simply a maid of the house.
Though then who was she? To her knowledge the Winterians did not have
a High Lady, though like everything else, Felix was beginning to doubt all she
knew. Something unpleasant stirred in her gut The woman was odd for certain,
her eyes sparked something Felix could recognize, determination. Not unlike the
other females Felix had come across, here the female seemed entirely
comfortable and not at all shadowed in a Male’s domain. Odd.
The woman glanced away from the fogged-crested window and tittle her
head at Felix. She resembled a bird in that moment, wide curious eyes and a
thoughtful expression, as if Felix were a nut she had yet to fully crack. It seemed
neither entirely knew what to make of the other.
“What brings you to Winter Felix?”
The question was placed gently, almost hushed as if trying to coo the
answer from her knowing it was something harsh. Felix’s throat tightened. While
in truth, she did not choose to ever even think of entering the Winterian border, it
remained she was not welcome home either. She couldn’t tell this woman
though, no one could know truly why she was brought here nor who she was.
Felix gulped in a breath and hardened her features.
“That, Winterian is none of your business, nor concern as last I checked
you are not the High Lord, and if that prick wants an answer he can bother to ask
me it himself”
Felix hid the quiet test behind her peaking annoyance, perhaps given her

149

bait at least she could find out who she was dealing with. Undeterred, the
Winterian chuckled and then turned towards the shut room doors.
“Alright fine, you all can come in now”
Just as the words left the woman’s mouth the chamber doors burst
forward and there stood four wide-eyed alert lieutenants and in the center a
scowling Silver eyes.

The room thrummed heavy with the combined twangs of magic, and for a
moment all that could be heard was the sharp crack of the hearth. The room
wasn’t the least bit cold yet still Felix’s skin rose to goose flesh as she eyed all of
her captors. While the lieutenants seemingly at ease upon sensing no threat,
silver eyes apparently found no such respite. From feet away Felix was sure she
could hear his sharp canines and teeth gnash together and perhaps even the
slightest growl puncture the air. Beside her, the female seemed only to huff
indignantly,
“We were talking. I told you it would be fine, what will it take for you to
actually listen”
Eyes never leaving Felix’s, Silver eyes seemed to stiffen for a moment
under the females scrutiny and hissed behind his teeth,
“All respect majesty, you must forgive me if I am not eager to see your
theory put to the test. Autmumnarians have a nasty habit of catching those under
my care unaware”
As he clenched out the words Felix could see his eyes blaze and from the
150

corner of her eye she spotted Catalyia grimace, yet all Felix could find herself
focusing on was one word. Majesty. A royal, a royal born to Winter.
Now it was Felix’s turn to stiffen and she pivoted abruptly re-evaluating
the female beside her. As Felix’s fists balled and she drew her mouth open to
snarl the room seemed to lower a few degrees and panting breaths left Felix in
fogs.
“Usurper”
Chalky ash covered Felix’s tongue and air grew tight in her throat. It was
her. The rising queen, Winter’s usurper, standing right beside her. The war, all
the slaughter that was to come, and the cause of it all stood less than an arms
reach. Venom acidic and broiling coated her tongue as Felix lunged, her eyes all
but conveying the flames she so wished to unleash. Before even her silken bonds
could respond Felix felt herself suddenly freeze. The magic in the room burst to
life. It was not Silver’s doing.
Even as he snarled and thrust forward ready to intervene, instead pure
white blinding light held Felix immobile.
The magic and scent were like nothing she’d ever encountered. Wisps of
sea, flame, ice and traces of earth assaulted her senses and the light while firm
didn’t sting or bite as the cold had. Felix gaped at the brunette, where her eyes
had once resembled snow now glowed like that of the purest white sun gaze.
Magic, a monarch’s magic.
