your injuries, you sustained we had to remove the leathers. Not to worry though
they’ll fetch a fair price likely right beside you.”
A feral snarl left Felix’s mouth; the Winterian shrugged indifference
though her lips were still quirked upwards. Swiftly she then moved to the side
and brandished a small sharp blade. Warning rang in her mind, but Felix stayed
still. With one deft move, the binds that had been rubbing her body raw came
loose all at once, and as quickly as it had appeared, the knife was gone somehow
hidden on the female’s slim figure. Felix still didn’t dare move.
“Now, let’s get you ready the Lords would have assembled by now, we’ll
finally get to see if your future as a maid will come to fruition.”
Felix rolled her eyes as her stiff muscles groaned as she stood up from the
chair, and she could swear her bones popped in realignment. Thoughts beat
restlessly behind her skull as her eyes took a cursory glance around the room she
had no concept of where she was, but she knew one thing to be sure even as the
female rebound her wrists in front of her, Felix would not be sold off like cattle.
One way or another, she would get out of these infernal bounds and, with any
luck, see her captors on their knees.

The maze of hallways seemed never-ending as the Winterian dragged
Felix through the door after door and twist after twist down old stone corridors.
As they continued onward, Felix fought to remember how they had gone from a
warm cabin to the dampened valley of tunnels. Closing her eyes Felix thought
back. The Winterian turned from Felix now bound and adjusted something one

the wall and before her stunned eyes, a hidden door from the sidewall popped
free, and they had descended into the headache of halls.
How had she missed the false panel? Felix berated her distracted mind
for missing the only feasible escape route. Though as they continued downwards,
Felix with a sinking feeling realized this way out would’ve been no better than if
she had plunged herself back into the unforgiving outer blizzards.
The cabin she had been held in was an outer entry to the byzantine
branching tunnel system that seemed to spread for miles. Felix eyed each door
they passed through searching for a landmark for any sort of grounding to make
sense of their path, but she was left almost assuming they had gone in circles.
Felix begrudgingly had to admire the efficient travel through the underground.
While she was hopelessly turned around, the Winterian’s eyes carefully tracked
over every stone and adeptly maneuvered her way through. Every five feet or so,
lanterns hung low, bleeding light onto the cold stone. The tunnels it seemed
could last for miles, how in Hellae did they maintain thousands of lanterns?
Below what felt like thousands of layers of fog and glass, Felix could
almost feel all of the tiny licking flames as they burned down their path. The
small lights were like a cruel tease. So close and yet the impenetrable fog inside
her blocked her access.
Upon the eighteenth turn, Felix let out a small grumble past her lips.
Maybe the Winterian wasn’t so adept after all. A shudder went through her at the
thought of being lost down here.
“Not a fan of the dark Autumnarian?”

“No, I just don’t particularly relish the idea of being stuck under cold
rock catacombs for eternity.”
The Winterian chuckled softly. “Inpatient, I see, well relax, we’ll be there
in a minute.”
She bit her tongue to keep from mentioning that they’d be walking
already for many minutes without any apparent signs of a destination. Then as if
Mother Light truly held a sense of humor, just as the thought passed through her
mind, the Winterian stopped, and almost as if it had appeared from magic, she
could just make out a set of stairs hidden in shadow leading up.
Laughter and raised voices assaulted her ears as they drew closer to a
small wooden door at the top of their hidden enclave. Bright light filtered from
beneath the door, and Felix had just enough time shut her eyes before
light-flooded before them. The Winterian tugged her forward, but Felix wasn’t
budging. From peaking out from behind her lids, she could see the room was
packed full of men. Ale and the scent of wood crackling within the hearth
reached her nose. Long tables were covered in pounds of meat, bread, and stews
as well as buckets full of mead and ale blanketed in bright torchlight. It was the
main Hall, that much she could tell immediately. It was almost like a queer
mirrored vision of back home. Even as she was hurried along in a side passage,
Felix got strange flashes of home; of their Hunt celebrations, which rivaled this
for its noise and for its rambunctious males.
“What is all this for?”
The Winterian barely gave a pause as she looked about and then pointed
to a short, scrawny young boy who sat towards the head of the table.

“There, he’s the thatcher’s boy he came of age today and passed his
trials.”
“A thatcher’s boy? All this is for him?”
Felix stared back at the room while it may not have been quite as glittery
as her home still the ensemble of men, food, drink, and celebration was
extensive. All for a thatcher’s son. Bewilderment caught Felix off balance.
Coming of age was rarely celebrated back home; those that were; were usually
nobility and sons of wealthy merchants. There was no way a Court could manage
so much for each of its children, and why would they?
“The boy’s village was on the border, parts of their main hall and other
buildings were burnt in an attack from Your kind. So the Court invited them to
commence their celebration here while their homes are rebuilt.”
Felix hid her further surprise. Her thoughts consumed trying to recall that
attack without making it clear she’d been actively involved.
The Haize had lightened near her men’s encampment. The usually thick
and opaque magic that kept their lands so separate was almost a shimmering
clear like looking through water. The men had been apprehensive, and she felt
the tangible effects of their enemies’ power and magic pulsing just behind the
barrier. They had kept a scout watching the border daily, scouring for any sign of
threat, and then had been when the wall fell. Only for a moment, it had been
small; nonetheless, their ancestor’s ancient protection had faltered.
Felix and her man had scrambled to ready themselves; the Winterian
forces were weakening the border; they needed to take a stand. They waited until
