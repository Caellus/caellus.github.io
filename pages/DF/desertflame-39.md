Daen’s remark surprised Felix and she turned to eye him wearily.
”I don’t belong here Winterian I am a prisoner, you brought me here”
Daen shrugged in response looking not at all concearned at her remark.
”Whatever you say Sparky, but like is drawn to like. You are a warrior
plain as day. You are meant to be around other warriors”.
Felix was silent for a long while after that.

Thallan
The shift had been easier this time. drawn out of his own volition Thallab
was pleased to be back in his most true form. His paws suck deep into the freshly
lade snow and his silver cat eyes scoped out before him.
He had set out not long after Daen had left with Felix, and while he did
not mention to his lieutenant that he would be following along, he got the sense
after a good few hours of the journey that Daen had sensed his presence.
Thallan watched as the Autumnarian took in the cold landscape and
smiled silently to himself at her awe when she caught sight of the glider. He
didn’t trust Felix, although he knew firsthand of how capable Daen could be, he
had known the same to be true of Catalyia and needed to be certain. Or at least
that’s what he told himself as he lumbered closer.
Once the pair came to the barrack enterance Thallan had begun to trun to
leave when something in him pulled him closer. He should go, he had other
responsibilities, plenty of them and yet he found himself wanting to watch the

161

Autumnarian. If for no other reason than perhaps he could gage and find out why
exactly the hellion was affecting his shifts.
Allowing his spotted tail to twitch behind him Thallan climbed up he
moutainside, forgoing the path the two had taken on foot and instead he found
his normal outcroping of stone just above the barracks training field.
He’d just watch for a litte while he ammended to himself. Make sure
Daen wasn’t in need of assistance and see what exactly the little Autumnarian
could do.
After a good quarter of an hour Daen and Felix lagging behind him
appeared from the barracks inner walls and walked out to the center of the
training field.
As a curtesy to Felix, Daen cleared the field reassigning drills so they
could have some semblance of privacy, Thallan’s chest bloomed in pride at his
lieutenant’s forethought. No matter that she was his opponent, having to train for
the first time before dozens of unfamiliar soldiers would have been an unneeded
cruelty. Not that Thallan believed Felix had one shy bone in her small form, she
certainly hadn’t been daunted the night she went toe to toe against him.
Daen and Felix settled in the center of a wide ring of white glassy stones
set into the earth. Magic field. Daen could choose whether or not he wished to
enagage it, either dampening any magic present or in some way altering their
surroundings, for now though he seemed satisfied just circling her.
Felix to her credit watched carefully and Thallan watched seeing the
gears in her mind process what was going to happen. Although he was just far

162

enough above them not to make out all that was said he knew the gyst of it.
Thallan had discussed plans with Daen the night before and understood what he
was going to do.
Daen was going to be fine, between the magic field, his own ability and if
at all else, the dozens of legions within the barrack walls, there was no way Felix
would escape and yet Thallan couldn’t bring himself to leave. Rather as the two
began a back and forth and Daen moved to release Felix’s leash, Thallan found
himself slinking closer until he was barely above the snow, allowing just his eyes
to peak through.
From where he was situated he was barely visible even to the keenest of
scouts. Yet even with his camofladge and fur shifting to match that of the
surrounding frost, Thallan could almost swear Felix looked at him.

Felix
She could feel it.
At first it had been faint, but now she was sure of it. Someone or
something was watching her. Felix’s mind raced alert. She gazed over the
surrounding training field, but saw nothing beyond her grinning infuriating
babysitter.
Daen slowly circled Felix within the ring of pale stone they’d entered and
Felix did her best to ignore the prickling she felt along her neck and instead focus
on the matter at hand. But as her eyes made one final sweep over the mountain
looming by them she caught just smallest fleck of silver. There crouched
163

surrounded by snow she saw them. Silver eyes. They were back again. Felix
twisted to stare at Daen but her overseerer it seemed found nothing amiss, could
he not see them? Or Light and Mother was she seeing things?
Felix shuddered and Daen took it as a sign she was cold, a signal to start
moving. Felix ignored the pressing silver irises, choosing instead to believe they
weren’t there. She again faced Daen waiting for his next move.
Daen had released Felix’s lilac leash which to her amazement and horror
managed to sliter back and somehoe disappear into her remaining silken
handcuffs.
”Now Sparky-”
Felix bit into her cheek at the nickname, but allowed Daen to continue.
”Here’s the deal. I am going to release your little bonds on the condition
of mutual understanding that you are going to remain inside this field, better yet
this circle for now.”
He paused to make sure she understood.
”I’m sure you could find some way to finegal past me, but I hope you’ve
come to realize that there really is nowhere for you to go. If you somehow
managed to get past the many dozens of legions behind me, there is nothing but
boudnless snow and ice for miles.”
”You will be caught, of that have no doubt.”
Felix wished she could protest find something in her to disprove the
Winterian’s words, but they rang true. If she even managed someway out of the
