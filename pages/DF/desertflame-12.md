title: Deserters Flame

The deepness of her voice was alien to Felix. Like another tone had
threaded through her vocal cords. The command she uttered was strong, a waves
shot into each of them, and one by one, all of them fell to their knees. Magic

harsh and blazing braided itself within her.
Each of them could feel it. The magic of fire forced them to bow on the
molten tiles beneath their feet. Blistering flame like nothing they’d ever seen
engulfed the hall.
“You see now, You do not control me, I have brought the Lord of Autumn
to his knees. I brought down his Lady, his whore, and I have brought down the
pathetic excuse of a man who claims to take my place.”
Lord Thiradin and Lady Aquin’s heads bowed. Her mother quivered a
mess puddled on the coal hot floor. Her gown in seared shreds. All that fine
affluence turned to ash. And finally, the commander kneeling below her feet. His
eyes glared into hers, and a vicious snarl lined his lips. He had a heart, even in
fear. Maybe his humbled state would have lessened his arrogance, allowing some
worth to show through, but it was too late for that now.
Felix lifted a hand and gently brushed the commander’s cheek as he
roared in agony. His face scabbed over with intense burns that would likely never
heal. His perfect pretty face was gone. Only the grotesque reminder remained.
Her hand slid down his face to his neck, and then his spine searing the flesh
through his uniform as she moved. His screams lifted through the air. Tears fell
from his eyes, and bloodied burns littered his body. She leaned down and sent a
mock sweet whisper to his ear.
“This is what happens when you play with Fire Commander. You wanted
to play, Let’s play.”
At last, Felix lifted her hand and the commander who could do nothing

but whimper, and eventually, he fell forward onto the palace tile. If he was
healthy and lucky enough not to succumb to her flames, Elryan would still never
lead again. His body too burned to ever fight with the same lethal brutality and
skill again. Not even the legendary sisters of Aeilyth could anything for him now.
“Felix Enough, you’ve gone too far!”
Her father rose to his feet, and his hands ignited into his own flame. His
eyes were alight again, too but, this time only in horror. But he stood nonetheless.
He reached his hand forward and commanded her to end her rampage. The two
opposing power shuddered through the palace rattling the very walls.
“Don’t you see Father, I am the only one capable, I am your daughter.
Don’t you see you cannot take away what I was born to do?”
The pain etched into her voice. Her Father met her sweltering gaze,
“All I see is a wildfire with no control, just rage, and No child of mine”
“Only the shell of her wrath.”
Something deep within Felix trembled at his words. It was too much, it
was all too much. In one final burst, all energy left within her exploded.
A blast so strong it shook the earth below. Her flames struck out in all
directions. And before her eyes as her fire caught her father’s chest and the
Highlord buckled.
As her inferno poured out from her, a flash of silver and a whisper of
Cold slammed into Felix’s mind, for a second gone was the encompassing
flames, for a moment she could feel again. Silver, silver and cold unlike any she
had ever felt before. And then Nothing.

All at once the red receded as she watched caught in her own horror. She
watched her destruction unfold, The walls hummed and melted until stone
reflected ember orange. The room exemplified the pits of Hellae as it thrummed
with her heat, and with it, her Father fell. His body, strong and forceful, slumped
forward, falling onto the burning tile as his flesh burned. “NO!” Felix’s ears rung
and it wasn’t until she watched the High Lady scramble towards her prone mate
that Felix realized the scream was her own.
Thiradin was still and unmoving. Lady Aquin yelled for him to rise, but
his chest barely lifted for breath. Tears dripped down the High Lady’s face. Her
own golden light magic began to slide down her fingers. Healing magic pulsed
from her fingertips. The golden light seeped into burnt flesh. Even as the High
Lady’s magic poured into her mate, he did not stir. Her yells turned into quiet
whimpering and sobs. Felix’s dark blackened orange magic met with Aquin’s
golden light, and the two tangled. Felix could feel the cool healing magic brush
against her own on the High Lord’s skin.
The wrath inside her was gone as soon as the silver-cold blasted through
her; just as her flames had met her father’s chest. Felix’s eyes had been just clear
enough to watch in devastated as he hit the ground. Her wings folded into her
back, and she fell to the floor hard her knees still vibrating on impact. No.
No-no-no. This wasn’t supposed to happen. Not to him. She’d never meant to
hurt him.
He had been right her father had been right. It had been too much for her
to control. She looked then to Elryan, and her consumed dinner threatened to
retch back up. His charred body was still on the ground alive but in agony. She

54

looked around the room as if the weight of her actions truly set in. And again, it
was as if the whole world could move around her, but she was stuck frozen.
Her mother and the High Lady crowded around Lord Thiradin. Just then
the guards finally burst into the room. They were much too late. Four men picked
up their fallen Lord and burned Commander took them to the palace healers. Two
men stationed themselves and restrained Felix. She didn’t resist. Her mind still
trying to grasp what she had done. Rolling waves of nausea and shock hit like a
reoccurring hurricane. She had done this. This was her fault. She was a monster.
“Guards hold Felix down bellow and restrain her magic. Do whatever is
necessary and see that she remains in the palace”
Lady Aquin’s voice was sorrowful but hard. She had always been an ally
to Felix until now. Her mate’s dire state overcame whatever friendship they
previously held, and now she was a threat to them. She was a threat to them all.
They were going to imprison her. They blamed her. Treason. If her father died,
they would kill her. Panic laced over her guilt, and she tried to run, but her feet
were stones.
