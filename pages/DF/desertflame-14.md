she was tempted to call upon her wings but then she began to fall. She yelled out
as air whistled around her. Falling. Sh was falling through the air too fast, her
wings wouldn’t come. Felix tried to scream but the sound was lost in the vacuous
space. Down. She fell far down the depths of the dark pit until she hit the firm
59

stone ground . . . hard. Pain seared through her nerve endings screaming out. At
least two bones were broken and many things were bleeding. She could only
whimper seeing as her jaw had cracked on impact.
Felix’s breathing was haggard and the iron tang of blood filled her mouth
threatening to block her throat. Her lungs wheezed and pain again flushed
through her, something had punctured it making it almost impossible to breathe
let alone the fact that multiple ribs were now broken or fractured.
It felt as if someone had crushed her body under a mountain and
continually crushed her into a pulp. She was bleeding internally. If she didn’t
find a healer soon her body would heal itself incorrectly. She winced as she felt
even the earliest beginnings of her skin struggling to mend itself back together.
The thought of each of her limbs healed backward and at odd angles made Felix
once again want to retch. Somewhere a venomous voice whispered she’d deserve
that fate after what she’d done to them.
She cursed so many times she was reasonably sure she was making up
new phrases now. Her thoughts repeated in the endless refrain of beating in time
with the thumping beat of her heart. Cool slickness dripped from her back, down
from her nose and lip, and from her temple. The gash on her back had reopened
tearing away all of Anollen’s efforts.
“Great just great”
She would be doomed with her injuries if she had been human. She
would have been dead immediately and at that point, Felix was envious of Mortal
fragility. Death would have at least doused the pain ricocheting everywhere in
her body. Her body lay broken. She wasn’t going anywhere.

“The damn stairs ”
Felix tried to move, to shift but wherever her mind called her limbs to
move agony was the only wailing reply. “Damn it” she all but gurgled. Tears
spilled from her eyes and fear shook her core quivering at the thought of being
forgotten and broken in the dark depths.
She was going to be stuck here. She was going to die. Hell if she wasn’t
found and then executed for treason she was going to die from the shitty cracked
stairs. She was never see her father again. Never get to feel the new autumn air
crackle against her skin as she flew. Never get to hear the sing of swords in the
training fields again. And she’d never get to dance before the eternal flame at
solstice again. Grief for her loses threatened to overtake her. Hedion, gods what
would happen to him? What would he think? Would he believe that she’d truly
committed treason? Or would he continue searching for her? She’d never get to
see him again, she’d never get to explain.
More tears fell and Felix wanted nothing more than to shut her eyes and
for it all to be done. Panic eroded its way into her mind and she was suddenly
falling again swirling in hopelessness. Her lungs were filling with blood and her
breaths became gurgled wheezes.
“Please”
Her voice was no more than a whisper when a wisp of air puffed near her.
Rubble shifted and it sounded almost like the crunch of pounding feet. She
opened her eyes but they wouldn’t adjust to the darkness. She listened but all
sound stopped. The fear that held her tightened its grip. She must have been
hallucinating the injuries were clouding her head. There wasn’t anyone there,
61

only her.
An odd warm gust hit Felix again only this time it seemed to be closer.
Unconscious shivers overtook Felix and her spine although broken still tingled at
the wind and then she felt it.
Magic. . . ancient magic like none she’d ever known. Archaic tongues
that hadn’t been spoken for centuries whispered in her ears. Whatever or
wherever the magic came from it was something elemental something older than
the stone she was encased in. Cool creeping and slithering spells and
enchantments meant to bind whatever was in the cavern covered her. For a
second it was like she could see in the darkness. Swirling colors of old script and
texts were all around her. The deepest purple and blues clashed against other
symbols bright orange that danced like the very flames Felix honed in her blood.
Hope and trepidation filled her as she stared in wonder. Her pain for a
moment forgotten. It felt like the world had opened and swallowed her into a
time forgotten. Then after a second blink, the colors were gone and she was once
again doused in the cold darkness.
“W-what. I-is there anyone there?”
Her voice quaked and sputtered, blood spilled from her lips. If she could
think past her next words and the gruesome pain from moving her mouth at all,
she would’ve been embarrassed at the bloody pathetic sight she must’ve been.
Why did she have to fall? Hadn’t the Light forsaken her enough? A cruel laugh
at her predicament bubbled up her throat. She had asked for help she had let her
weakness show and this is what she got in return. Her hysterical laughter shook
her body erupting more and more anguish with each vicious jerk.

“Hush Faerie”
She froze. A deep command rolled over her and her stiffened muscles
seemed to relax as if suddenly ordered by invisible puppet strings. Whatever it
was it was powerful, more than her and more than anything else she had ever met.
Power wasn’t the word to even describe whatever it was. It was beyond
that of mortals or even that of her own kind. Whatever it was it held the very feel
of something pure. And in one terrifying revelation, Felix realized that the warm
wind that periodically hit her wasn’t wind. It was the exhale of breath.
“W-what are you?”
It was silent for a long time and suddenly the ground shifted and the
warm breath came closer almost to scorching heat. It was coming closer.
“Child I am something long before your time. Something Ancient”
Felix in her shattered form would never admit out loud but, she was very
very afraid. She tried to focus and make out the things from in the pitch
blackness but her eyes could not place where it was, the only sign was where the
beast breathed. Every primal message her body sent was the wish to escape to
