## Prologue
Esperanza

The bristling cold bit down into her very core she thought with a grimace
Esperanza was not meant to be cold, her warm Summerian blood was meant for
the light and heat of the twin suns. Her bright caramel brown eyes narrowed and
glared at the stormy grey sky looming above her head. 

Eight years, it had been
eight years since the sun was covered in the grey. 

Eight years since the Winterian
kings sieged all over the world.
Eight years since they murdered the Summerian Monarch and usurped the High Lady of Spring, slaughtered the Autumn High Lord. And it had been eight
years since Winter decreed its dominion over all of Tehlaeya. 

And after eight
years, she was tired of being cold.
Esperanza Eliean looked at the grey sky and then looked back to the
rolling snow-covered hills in front of her. Hundreds of Faerie and creatures of
magic all stood at attention lined together as far as the eye could see. All there
for one reason.

Esperanza gazed over Valaen, the last border between Winter, Autumn,
and Spring, filled to the brim with men and women ready to lay down their lives.
Hundreds of Thousands of gathered all in the hopes that they could once again be
free.

Across the barren cold earth, their enemies stood firm. Winterian Faerieand beasts of old too dark to match any tongue or word spoken to utter their names stood ready to meet them. A quiver of fear shook her, and she felt the urge
to run, to escape the hundreds of thousands of Winterian soldiers determined to
strike her down, to quell their rising rebellion that had already claimed the lives
of so many of her people. 

Then her gaze met the head of the enemy camp. Four dark, cruel gazes twinkled even from across the battlefield. The Four Winterian
Kings. Their power throng across the valley ready to once again decimate
whatever stood in their path. Even from afar, Esperanza felt its icy coils permeate
the air calling for death. And despite it something in her strengthened. 

They would not know another victory. They would not slaughter anymore innocents.
Never again.
