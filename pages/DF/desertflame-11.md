Chapter V
Felix
Silence swallowed the room whole. Winterians. . . War. Goose bumps
lifted Felix’s skin, like the slave girl’s frost and cold air biting into her, War. It
had been centuries since the courts had been summoned to the neutral grounds.
Aaphire was almost that of myth, the summons of each High Court. Limeare
help them.
Her father was the first to react to the news, and his face gathered into an
unreadable expression. Gone was her father, the benevolent High Lord the Court
knew, instead, the War Lord, the general who lead the western front. The Sword
of the North and General at Vaelan took his place. The young man who and lead
rebels out of the Winterian’s autumn camp and the second under Gabrielle
himself.
“Elryan, send for the legions in the west and south and pull them forward
we need to get the camps set up along the border . . . we need to get everything
ready.” Felix’s whole body froze. Wild energy and chaos engulfed and roared in
Felix’s ears. She suddenly went silent. Like everything around her kept moving,
and she was the only thing stationary.
“Give me command.”
The demand was quieter than her usual shout, but still, it seemed to echo
in the room, and it caused everyone else in the room to freeze as well. In her own
ears, she thought she’d whispered it. This was what she was meant for, what

48

she’d trained for.
“Honestly Felix this is hardly the time-”
Her mother’s whine broke through the silence, but everyone seemed to
ignore it. Her father’s face twisted in protest and frustration as her mother
continued to squawk her disapproval.
“Give me command!”
Rough and guttural, the need to take control swept through her body. She
looked into Lord Thiradin’s calculating eyes. Pleading that he would actually see
reason. That his new hardened shell would not fall prey to his overprotective and
prejudiced nature.
“I am the best commander we have.” She had to correct herself from
saying only. “If the Winterians have decided to let themselves be known, I am
the best one to Cut. Them. Down. I will do what you did before.”
Behind her, Elryan scoffed indignantly at her sharp remark. She was a
female forced to beg at the foot of males. She had to ask for permission and she
hated it with everything in her. Elryan’s eyes narrowed at Felix as if seeing her
for the first time and suddenly getting a sour taste in his mouth.
“Elryan mobilize the men now.”
Felix snarled at her father. The messenger that she previously crouched
by jolted away. This was her home and her command. She’d earned her place,
and she was going to defend it! Seething thoughts boiled in her mind endlessly
as her rage began to rise.

“No! I will fight, you will not take away my right-”
“You are my Daughter, you have the rights I say, and you will listen and
follow as I tell you to. This is War Felix, I will not risk losing the sole heir to this
Court.”
His Bastard, Through he didn’t say it, the word branded over her skin.
Nothing but a mistake heir. The whirlwind of crashing emotions hit hard, his
denial, his condescending dismissal, and lastly, the degrading title, Felix was
after all only his bastard daughter. A female and not even a legitimate one worth
genuine concern.
Let them see who you are; show them what right you have,
There was no thought, just roar, the drumming heat in her blood. Intense
fire spread and tickled over her spine, down her arms, and she could feel the
flames lick every curve crevice like a Lovers touch as it drowned her entirely.
Her eyes no longer saw, there was only the red.
The muscles in her back expanded, reptilian scaled skin slid from her
flesh, and slowly her feet lifted from the ground. Her magnificent wings. Black
and shimmering as if each scale was that of the most brilliant obsidian. Her
wings were that of night and true essence of the flame.
Felix’s leathers could do nothing to hold in any of her wrath. Blistering
heat scorched the room. Whatever beauty the room held, melted away or charred
from her growing heat.
You hold more power than all of them, they deny you your right. Show
Them.

Fire commanded her body. It wasn’t her in power to control; it was the
reverse.
“The cursed! She’s . . . she’s a Dragon Scale.” Elryan’s voice cracked and
his face paled, as he pointed at her wings, shaking. He was afraid.
Good They all should be afraid.
Her mother was choking on her breath, stuck gawking. All of them could
feel her heat. Redness branded their faces. Like standing too close to the sun,
they each got burned. Fear coated the room, an invisible fog that clung to their
skin. Felix could feel it coming off each of them. Even the Lord of Autumn. Her
Highlord. They would see now, they would all see who and what she was. Her
father had known, had tried to hide it, keeping her far from the palace, well now
he locked her inside it, and he would see the consequences.
“Monster. You will burn us all.”
Though he tried to appear fierce the young Commander’s voice had toned
itself too high, and his unceasing shaking spoke volumes. He was terrified. If she
were in control, Felix would’ve been satisfied with watching Elryan soil himself
at her feet, but no, she needed him to have a more permanent mark. So he would
always remember exactly who it was that brought him to his knees.
Let them see who has control, show them all see
“Kneel”
