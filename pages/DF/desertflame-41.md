my men in their sleep. So do you need anything else? To relieve yourself at all
perhaps?”
Daen even managed to appear somewhat sheepish as he mentioned
locking Felix in. Where they had left all outside the ring, it seemed their
indivitual stances inevitably had returned. Still Fellix couldn’t find it in herself to

169

fault the male. Were she in his position she wasn’s sure she’d do any different.
Instead of putting up any fuss Felix shook her head and let out a quiet thanks for
the meal. Daen nodded and once the door firmly closed behind her Felix could
barely hear the quiet click of the lock.
Felix inhaled the modest stew dinner and sat on her small cot. Sleep
called to her, she turned to stare out of the small slit window barely more than the
size of her hand, she watched as new snow began to fall and she let her body
slow and relax. Just before she succumed to sleep Felix caught one final glimpse
of a familiar silver gaze.
***
After the first night Felix found herself falling in some form of a routine.
For the next few days Daen would rouse Felix at Dawn and the two would train
and spar until both of them were drenched in sweat and she could barely remain
standing.
True to his word Daen left all animosity outside the sanctity of their ring
and when they both entered all pretense beyond two warriors fell away.
Eventually other soldiers joined the two, none entered their ring but pairs
fought alongside them, occasionally Felix would feel a fleeting glance here and
there, but she never let it steal her focus, she couldn’t afford to.
Daen kept Felix on her toes more so than she had ever been in her life.
She flet as her muscles strained but grew and stregthened overtime and Daen’s
relentless guidance. Sometimes she’d let herself wonder what Hedion would
think if he could see her now, would he admire how much she’d learned? Or

170

would he scorn her for allowing herself to become so intertwined with her foes.
Every morning Felix told herself she was doing it for survival and to
continue the ruse of complacentcy, that she wasjust waiting for her time to strike.
As the days grew on she didn’t let herself question whether or not that remained
true.
On the eighth day their easy routine ended. Daen recieved word he was
needed back at the manor and so with the morning’s light the two set off, all
pretense that had been laid to rest resurfaced as Felix was rebound and reminded
just where her freedom lay.
The trek back to the manor was uneventful and soon the familar dark
walls and the gleaming jewel-eyed jackals stood before them. Felix eyed the two
house guardians, even while in stone it felt like they were staring at her. She
admired the craftsmanship and beauty taking in the Manors front for the first
time in real light.
”That’s Jasper and Aspen, they stand guard over this place, I’d keep my
distance”
Daen patted Felix’s shoulder and shrugged past her towards the Manor’s
door. felix watched as it opened by some unseen servant and within the entryway
the last of her babysiters she had yet to meet stood. The males raven-black hair
and snowy-pine green eyes paler than her own sparkled in the Manor’s torchlight.
According to Daen the male’s name was Kaerynn. In the days prior she’d
been able to glean most of her captors names all but Silver eyes. Kaerynn was
quiet, similar to the white-blond haired female, Ithira. The group managed an

171

even balance between the louder Daen and Catalyia with Kaerynn and Ithira
acting as the more withdrawn counterpart. Four pillars each holding their own
place. Felix eyed Kaerynn carefully, she still knew little about any of her
watchers. Least of all him.
”Glad to see you made it back”
Even his voice was gentler, quieter and more lilting. Those pale green
eyes met her own and Felix nodded subtly. Daen guided her forward and once
the Manor door shut soundly behind her, Felix’s lilac bonds disappaited.
Shocked at her newfound freedom Felix massaged her wrists though in truth they
were barely sore. Far less than that of her people’s iron shackles.
”The Manor will keep you within its walls there are little need for those
now, so long as you do not harm any of those dwelling within, they can remain
off”
The deep timbre voiced from behind her cause a shiver to escape along
her skin. She straightened her shoulders and Felix shifted to meet his silver stare.
His eyes held hers for a moment, they were dimmer today, they seemed only to
probe her for a response.
”I understand”
Her voice was rough, neither kind nor purposely hostile, he seemed to
regard her inkind and nodded wordlessnly shuffling past her and shared a look
with Daen and Kaerynn before disappearing down another hallway.
”Head his words, but don’t let his manners offend you, he’s like that with
everyone, if ever there is a day Thallan isn’t brooding then he’s likely sick”
172

Daen’s voice continued on but Felix wasn’t paying attention. Thallan,
that was his name. Felix stared after where she’d seen his form recede off to but
made no move to follow.
”What now?”
Felix asked still not lifting her gaze.
”Well, Thallan and Ithira are busy taking care of official business but I’m
sure we can find someway to keep ourselves busy”
Daen smirked and Kaerynn seemed to sigh beside him, whatever the male
meant Felix was sure she’d find out.
