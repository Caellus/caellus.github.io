her blow for blow that had almost overtaken him. He no longer bothered him that
she was female. She fought like a male brute of her kind and so he’d treat her as
such, but then he’d sensed her blood.
A different rage had ignited in him when he’d scented her life’s blood.
Her blood, spilt and he’d wanted to tear himself apart. He’d gone too far, and yet
when he tried to stop and rectify his mistake, the Autumnarian had the gaul to
fight against him; she was hurting herself!
In the end, he’d had to use his magic to stop her even as she’d stared at
him with betrayal and outrage darkening her gaze as if to silently scream out that
he had cheated. Something in him squirmed under her scrutinizing gaze, he’d
suddenly felt wrong. He’d genuinely meant before not to use his magic. He’d
relented when she laid down the rule. Though the urge to resist and feel his blood
freeze with his own magic was strong, he would honor her demand after all; if he
didn’t, it never would have been a fair fight.
He’d let his magic change to a low buzz barely perceptible, but when he
pinned her, it rolled in waves. He’d scarcely kept it at bay. When he realized she

was hurt, his control snapped.
Thallan’s scowl smoothed over as he emerged from the great hall, ice and
snow met him in the wind. The cold was a welcome reprieve after recounting
every part of his encounter with the flaming faerie.
Snow crunched under his boots as he strayed from the stone-lined path.
As his steps wandered, his gaze traveled to the rising mountains. The Frost
seemed to glow pearlescent under the waning moonlight and opaque night sky.
Faint traces of emerald and cobalt flashed through the air. A beautiful reminder
forever of the Haize and the barrier between his people and all the Courts.
Before realizing it, Thallan’s steps stopped as he reached his Manor. Far
and away separated from the rest of his people there it stood. Slowly his
frustration thawed as he grew closer to his home.
Though his domain back within the center of his Court loomed within his
White Palace, officially the lair of the High Lord, this manor darker and alluring
was his true home.
Torches lit up the windows beckoning the wayward traveler to its warmth.
No one knew of his true home, but his lieutenants and . . . now the Autumnarian
captive. He didn’t let himself question why he didn’t simply send her to the
barracks or even a cell to heal. He wouldn’t dwell on his thoughts. But even
briefly he could feel it, he felt responsible for her. He’d found her, and then also
coincidentally re-wounded her, thus his responsibility. Nonetheless he would not
let himself draw too much into these thoughts, distractions.
He knew he should have ventured inside his friends would be waiting for

him, as would his new feisty and injured guest, but weight pounded upon his
shoulders, and he longed to run, to just keep his distance just for a moment
longer. A familiar call from the wind whistled in his ears, calling him away;
away from it all. Beckoning him to abandon in the cold and ice.
Thallan continued past his glowing windows, past the Manor’s grand
doors, and up the mountainside, growing farther and farther from the weight that
seemed to cling to his shoulders. The wind roared around him and pulled at his
magic, and finally, as one with the blissful cold, he let go. Light flashed in a
single bright burst, and painlessly Thallan’s bones cracked and reformed. Skin
and clothes morphed into a thick white pelt of fur, spots emanating the snow
dappled trees covered his form and where the High Lord of Winter stood before
now prowled the powerful form of the last Winterian Frost-Leopard.
As his breath fogged through the air, everything crew clearer sharper as
details of the night and snow came to light. Scents of swift wind and prey carried
to him, and every sense was suddenly more.
Let Go,Come Farther Away, you’re of Cold and Ice, join with the Wind
Come Away
Whispers on the wind ticked his ears as he felt himself roaming farther
towards the mountains. Freedom and cold echoed in his bones, effortless
thoughtless freedom boomed in his mind as his large paws thrummed down on
the crunching snow up and up the mountain. Distantly the thought of his manor
and those waiting for him filtered through, but the wind’s whispering howl
quickly ebbed away at the thought and all others attempting to usher him back.
Come Follow the Wind, Let Go. Let the Cold Bring you Home Let the
114

Cold Free
The wind picked up until it swirled around him, his magic fully melded
with the elements as he continued up. He reached the Mountain’s peak and the
stars seemed a breath away as the stars and black sky enveloped him. The
Mountain was above it all, breathless thoughtless freedom.
Before the Thallan there it was, the pool of midnight, the lake’s black
waters calling him ever closer, echoing the whispers of the wind. The snow
leopard prowled further entranced by the sparkling midnight depths. Small
tingles of warning pricked on Thallan’s neck, his fur rising yet still the whispers
called and abandon brought him closer towards the precipice.
Just as Thallan lifted his paw towards the inky lapping waters, a sudden
and quick emerald-gold flash blew in his eyes, drowning out the wind and all its
whispers. For a single moment he could almost smell something, spice and heat,
and then it vanished.
Time around Thallan paused briefly as he stared into the pool. Warning
and exhaustion pulled at his senses, drawing him away from the waters.
Thallan’s thoughts remained absent as he continued farther from the lake.
Fatigue weighed down his bones until he finally slumped laying atop the
mountain, Just before blackness pulled his senses into sleep, Thallan saw only
stark emerald flecked with turquoise and gold pushing him to rest. Emerald eyes
with gold danced in his dreams as the last of the great leopards slept atop the
great North Mountain.

Dawn’s beckoning brightness pickled against Thallan’s eyelids as he
awoke immersed in snow blanketing across his frame. The Frost Leopard once
again shifted back to Faerie. Thallan’s muscles ached, and the cold bit at his skin
as he stirred. Once fully awake, his eyes widened and craned to take in the sight
