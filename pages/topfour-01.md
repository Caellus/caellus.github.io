By the time I make it out of the shower, the natural light outside is dark, and Francis leaves the reminder, it is time for our evening meal. Before heading to the canteen, I dragged my feet to the still open training center. But my feet froze in place when I see the heavy bag which before had smears of blood from my knuckles was now clean.

“Francis?”

The automated voice dings in response, “Yes, Cadet Gerrard? How may I be of assistance?” 

“Did you clean and reset the training center?”

“No, Peter the new assignment did that shortly before exiting”

While part of me stood there still confused, the other parts of me battle back and forth, one part wishing to throttle my new room assignment and question why he cannot merely leave me be, and the other pull for me to find the bastard and thank him regardless. I end up doing neither and instead shut off the lights and walk towards the echoing activity of evening meal.

The canteen is filled to the brim, and this time the seating arrangement is not assigned open. As soon as I entered, I could see Alex and Jude call me over, but my eyes scan over the rows of tables until I see at the only empty table sits a tall chestnut-brunette with grey eyes that at the moment were downcast into a book. Odd, I would’ve thought he’d sit with Granger. I start towards Alex and Jude’s table when my feet halt. My mind flashed back to the training room and the cleaned heavy bag, and reluctantly I turn and walk to the empty table.

“Yes?”  he arched a brow at my approach, and my glance met his.

“You know you do not have to be alone, there’s plenty of room at, frankly, any of the other tables. Even Granger’s”

At his prior roommate's name, his face seemed to grow paler by an infinitesimal amount considering he could have already camouflaged himself in a snowdrift. Without meaning to my eyes slide over towards the center tables, and I spot Granger Belaire’s tall built frame.  

The Academy’s esteemed head boy is seated with the other top cadets of our year. He sits in the middle of the table and even from the edge of the room it’s like a beacon is around him. Granger is the epitome of ease. He laughs as the boys around him joke and snicker. From this viewpoint, it’s hard to believe he’s the best in our unit. He looks like a simple teenager; mussed hair, slight stubble, his appearance shows nothing of the obedient strait-laced sharpshooter captain we’re told to follow. After having noticed my cursory glance, Peter actually deigns to speak.

“Somehow, I’m not entirely sure Granger nor posey of lieutenants would appreciate my company. I’m better off over here.”

A slight blush peeks over the corners of his ears, but as soon as it’s there, it vanishes. He stares back toward his mashed potatoes silent once again. I heave a shrug and sit at the seat across from him. And although the clamor of noise around the canteen doesn’t lower, it’s as if every eye has suddenly landed on my back. So much for avoiding other’s attention today.

“Well, in that case, do you mind company?”

I figured he again wouldn’t answer and continue to stare are the creamy off-white mash on his plate but, he looked up at me, and what I assume to be a grimace on anyone else seems to almost be a smile on his face and not that infuriating smirk.

“Company would not be … unpleasant”

That might as well have been a shining compliment. After that, both of us quietly resumed eating, and at a snail’s pace. Slowly I felt other’s eyes cease staring. Well good, none of their damn business anyway. I shifted, and for a sec, my eyes again drift to the center tables, and I find Granger Belaire staring directly at me, his smile remains but his eyes wain into something cold, and a chill lifts on my spine.

	The rest of the meal finishes without incident, and no sooner than we’ve all devoured our rations do the curfew warnings radio through the halls. We all slug through the halls heading to our blocks, and neither Peter nor I say much as we head to our newly shared room. We both seem to slow upon the threshold, and around me, I feel people’s subtle looks at my shoulder as they pass, some with curiosity of how my new roommate and I will get along and others with sympathy, pity, and the last few with indifference. The latter is my favorite, while the other on-lookers set my teeth on edge. Rather than continue to give them all something to watch, I pass through the doorway towards the bunks without waiting. 

The tension was like thick smog coating the walls, coating each breath through my lungs, while there were two bunks, each with two beds. My eyes skip over mine and the empty cot above mine. Each bunk, respectively, was for one cadet. The top was for sleeping while the bottom for gear, but I had always preferred being closer to the ground. One night Ben had decided to take the bed above mine. He never bothered to explain why. It was just that. And after initiate year, he never really had a reason to. It just was. Was, every night even with all his noise, every night until now. 

Without a word, Peter headed to the unused bunk across from mine and climbed up the latter. The metal groaned slightly, and I already knew it’d be just as bad as Ben’s tossing and turning. For a second, my eyes glanced over to the corner again, looking for the clutter. As if still searching for what my mind screamed was already gone.

“-he was quite tidy.”

My thoughts whisked away. I turned to Peter, who was again looking at me. Great.
“What?”

“Your roommate, your past one,” he seemed to pause as if feeling the need to specify. 
“he was quite tidy, nothing here is out of place, the bed is perfectly made.”

Subconsciously it takes my mind time to realize the humorless laugh was slipping past my mouth.

“No. No, he was anything but tidy well, not conventionally. He kept his gear all in order and everything else, but his trinkets and project would be everywhere. Ben would make a mess somedays that could cover the floors so bad it was a fire hazard, the bed’s made because it was never unmade, not since the hall service made it almost five years ago.”

That was the most I had talked about it, any of it, since the incident. My throat suddenly ached as if only coming to grips with how much I had just relayed, much less to a stranger. 

Peter didn’t respond, and I didn’t wait for him to. I crawled into my bunk and rolled on my side away from him and shut my eyes. Like with the last two nights, the bed felt empty, and even with the warmed synthetic covers, my body shivered.

“Good night Lance,”

It was the first time, the first real-time he’d ever said my name, and with my eyes closed tightly, I could only mutter a quiet answer as all I could think was his stiff European lilt was nothing like Ben’s. 
The night was silent, and when the lights darkened, I opened my eyes, it was about a quarter of an hour until I heard Peter’s breath even out and I continued to listen. Like every other night since, I waited, and sleep never came.
