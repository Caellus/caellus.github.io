take action, Thallan was certain the other Courts would not give them much
choice.
“You’re right, of course you’re right. I’m sorry you came with something
on your mind”
Aeilre emerged from behind the screen, shaking herself free of the heavy
thoughts. She was swept in silver and blue silks that clung to her delicate frame.
Thallan glanced across her, every bit the ethereal beauty and grace of the High
Queen she was born to be. Respect and Pride warmed his chest. Then
remembering the issue at hand with a slow breath Thallan signed,
“It’s getting worse. I can’t control it” Aeilre’s twilight and ice eyes met
his and stared intently almost as if scanning for injury or mishap.
“The shifts, they’re increasing?”
Thallan nodded stiffly. “And where you end up, close to the Mountain-”
“I’m at the peak Aeilre, it’s getting worse”
Concern knitted her brow and Thallan felt the cold coil of shame tighten
in his chest. His shifts had always been a sore spot. He hated the look in others
eyes, always in their eyes. The very same looks everyone aimed at his kind
before- Just as his frustration mounted ahead he remembered it.
“But it was different this time, something pulled me back, a flash of

144

something,”
He sounded like a mewling pup. Thallan’s teeth ground tightly, his own
rage at his helplessness rising. But he needed her council and if need be,
permission to interrogate his new guest further. Aeilre’s curiosity twitched in her
brow and she motioned for him to continue.
“It is something strange, the intruder, somehow it relates to her”
Thallan’s own brow furrowed attempting to describe what exactly he
thought he understood.
“Your new guest. . . you believe she has something to do with your
shifts?”
Aeilre glanced at the High Lord once again surrendering him to her
penetrating gaze. Thallan again nodded silently waiting for her decision. Hot
pricks of annoyance danced along his spine as he was reminded of the
Autumnarian Faerie. Nothing but trouble.
“Well if that is the case, I had better and go meet this guest for myself”
Herself. His queen was going to see Felix herself. Thallan’s mind reeled.
Fuck.
Reasons for the uprising monarch not to take time to interrogate a simple
border guard flooded on his tongue. One look in her eyes though and recognized
his efforts would be futile.Thallan opted for a short bow, and turned dismissing
himself. Her decision was made. His captive would soon face his queen and in
that moment he hoped to all the hells, that either was ready for the other.

Chapter XIV
Felix
Someone was moving, was the first thought that Felix registered as black
oblivion faded. Thankfully her head wasn’t pounding quite as ruthlessly. Mother
above she needed to stop waking up like this.
The pitter-patter of light feet filtered into Felix’s sharp ears, a slow groan
slipped from her lips. It was too bright as the morning’s creeping glare sifted
through her dry eyelids. Just outside of her vision Felix could make out a slight,
shifting silhouette. It was then something pulled in the back of her mind, she
wasn’t home, whoever these people were they were enemies.
Silently Felix did her best to calm her rising chest and instead let her
sharp ears filter in everything around her.
“Since you’re up would you like some water? I’d guess you must be
thirsty”
And just like that Felix shot up. Before her stood perhaps one of the most
delicate of females she’d ever laid eyes on. And the most striking deep-night
irises laced in pale blue. They glowed at her like the new fallen snow, that which
she had only begun to catch glimpses of from her rooms windows. Blue eyes and
speckles of something else, something hidden beneath the surface. In this
woman’s eyes Felix felt both a weight and a light for which she had never known
its equal.
The woman all together despite her eyes, and slight gaze seemed at all

146

else, ordinary. Dark rosewood locks hung well below her shoulders curling
gently. Her clothes were light, the color of greying skies with brushes of white
and ice blue. A servant or house maiden perhaps.
“What are you doing in my room? And why mother above can’t someone
at least warn me before I get a new babysitter?”
Felix’s throat truth be told was dry and water would have been lovely, but
her own peaking fury won out. She was tired, tired of waking up with no sense,
tired of constant intrusions and tired of no bleeding control.
“Do prisoners where you are from normally get awarded such privileges
of who, and when their captors should arrive?”
The woman’s voice laced with dry humor. Felix’s cheeks heated, truth be
told she was mortified at just how used to her confinement she’d become. Of
course they would keep her imbalanced and unaware. Behind all the pretty sheets
and silks still lay prison walls.
“No, though we don’t normally make a habit of hiding behind false
niceties either. The water, this fine room and even my silk bonds, whatever you’re
seeking for Winterian, regardless of finery I promise you will not find it in me”
By the time she’d finished Felix’s chest pounded as small pants escaped
between parted lips. Felix waited for the woman to react, to shout or curse or
even just to attempt to prove her wrong, little prepared her for the genuine laugh
that echoed around her room.
The female’s featured lightened drawing in true mirth and her eyes even
dared grow glossy as if from unshed tears. She was laughing at her. Felix was
147

certain she’d said nothing laughable. Between this woman and Catalyia, Mother
above.
“Had we known providing decency would make you so uncomfortable, a
