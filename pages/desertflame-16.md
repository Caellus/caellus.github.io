It had growled at her,threatened her, and she could feel its predatory rage coming off of it in waves.

Was it laughing at her pitied state? Was she really that low to the point where it amused the hellae beast before it killed her? Her cheeks burned . . . she was
embarrassed. Light take her from this mocking creature.

“so you accept death? child, not many face that . . . you are brave. stupid
but brave. you will live. your time to leave this world has not yet come, Though
you may deserve death i will not be the one to grant you that kindness. this world has use of you yet. but if you challenge me again, i will make your existence worse then hellea’s realm.”

The beast’s whisper scraped her ears. Like that of grinding stones. It
wouldn’t kill her. Felix didn’t want to die, not truly, but she wanted the pain to stop. “If you won’t kill me, then what? Am I now a prisoner stuck here to slowly wither away?”

She bared her teeth in frustration. She wasn’t allowed to live how she
wanted, nor was she able to die. She was a prisoner in the world above, and now
a prisoner down below in this stupid pit. She wanted to hit something. To slash
and stab. The Light had forsaken her. She was alone, and she was tired of
whining. She wanted to hurt something. To burn.

“Get. Off. Of. Me.”

She growled back at the beast crushing her body, and even though she
couldn’t find its eyes in the darkness, she hoped it could see her fearsome glare.

“you have some fight in you faerie a never-ending fire. you have been beaten, and yet you still struggle and refuse to give up even when hopelessly outmatched. how . . . . interesting.”

Something warm and wet and forked slid along Felix’s cheek. Her
shoulders tensed, and waves of disgust rolled through her. What, in hellae, was
that? She thought for a moment, and Felix froze. A tongue. Felix was just tasted.

The beast touched her with its tongue!

“W-what – How dare you! Don’t . . . taste me! What were you doing?”

She felt so disgusted. The beast wouldn’t kill her, but it would taste her?
Why? What did she taste like anyway? Bloody, sweaty, dirty, she can’t have
tasted good.

“hush child. you always make such a fuss. that was as pleasurable for me
as it was for you. i needed to be sure.”

“Sure of what?” Felix was irritated she had been cut, stitched, yelled at,
punished, locked away, chased, she had fallen into the pit of despair with this
beast, and now she had been tasted by a beast how just insulted her for her taste.

“You are Dragon Scale. you have ancient blood of my kind in you faerie.
your fire i could sense as soon as i felt your flesh. you are the last of your kind as well, it seems. your father has kept your heritage from you and kept you in bonds to hide what you are.”

“That’s not true! I know what I am. I know I am a Scale. My father told
me the truth. He doesn’t keep things from me!”

“is that so? do you know your history, what you can do? do you know the
full extent of the history and responsibility that rests on your shoulders? your
father gave you leathers for your protection, or did he give them to you to hide
what you could be for the protection of others. You may know your wings, but
faerie you know little to nothing.”

Felix tried and failed to withhold her frustration. The beast was
condescending her like some silly child. In retrospect, it probably was accurate
the beast was well likely thousands upon thousands of years old. Felix’s teeth
ground together, and she huffed. With any strength, she tried to pry herself out
from under the dangerous monster, but . . . to no avail, she moved less than an
inch, and instead, she just cut more of her flesh on the razor-edged rubble.

“So all-mighty one what do I apparently not know,” her voice was laced
in sarcasm,

In the depths of the gloom, it seemed for a second that the thing braced above her was . . . snickering? Hellae, the beast had a sense of humor. Who
would’ve known that even a hellish pit couldn’t take away a monster’s humor?

“Before you tell me ancient thing, could you get off me before I become
permanently flattened into the rocks?”

The rubble shifted, and Felix could swear she heard her bones groan from
the absence of weight, and her lungs could finally take more than shallow breaths.

Finally, she could move. Her arms weighed tons as she moved them slowly.

“It is not my place to tell you your own secrets and demons. you must
learn them yourself dragon scale. but i can tell you this; war is coming. you must survive, you must live for the hope of our kind’s survival. the time will come for sacrifice. you have your own role to play. you are not meant to be a part of this. That is not your fate.”

The words tickled over her skin, a prophecy of sorts etched forever in her
memory. Of course, it had to be unclear. No ancient one could ever be
transparent in what they meant; it would ruin their “mystic” vibe. Felix grumbled as she struggled to sit upright. Sweat dripped from her brow, and again the warm oozing blood flooded down her back from the slash wound.

“My Fate ancient one is mine to choose. I will fight as I always have, and
you nor anyone else will stop me. This is my war to fight like it is everyone else’s.”

“Then you damn us all! You will be the end of our kind, you insolent
child!”

Felix was tired of this. Ancient ones, wars, Fate. She was a soldier no
different than any of the men she fought side by side with. Fate nor anything else would stop her from defending her people. She would fight till her last breath and she would end anyone who stood in her way. She would burn the Winterians to the ground!

Felix Pushed herself once more to stand and she again glared at the beast.
Heat of her own fire blossomed up her veins and she called it to roar through her.

Fire, flames, and heat that was her purest essence. Mother Light had given her
flame, and she would forever cherish it, now it was her weapon.

“You will not stand in the way of defending my people or else you will
burn like every other who tries to stop me”

Deep primal hatred seared into her core and she rose her palms and
blistering orange light filled the dark cavern and Felix stood agape at the beast before her.
