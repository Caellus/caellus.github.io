The blades were magnificent. Felix’s eyes caught the danging sunligth
shine off the silver scaled handles. The vicious blade glinted and whispered to
something deep inside her. The metal was darker than any steel she’d ever seen,
with toils of folded steel forced to make the blade allowing for a wicked sort of
glow. Handcrafted silver and steel twisted and dented creating a beautiful scaled
pattern giving the blades a perfect grip.
The servant approached and Felix hesitantly raised a hand to touch the
beautiful items before her.
”You’re allowing me to have weapons?”
Felix lifted a critical brow waiting for either of her two captors to sweep
forward and snatch away her surprising gift. Maybe it was a ploy, perhaps to set
her at ease? Or maybe to earn her trust so she lay down her guard. Still she
couldn’t help the small bit of thrill that buzzed through her as she picked up one
of the mesmerizing daggers.
It somehow fit perfectly in her hand, letting the loop at the end spin
around her finger Felix felt as if the blades were an extension of her arm, a part
187

of her. Under her palm small blue jewels glowed and Felix could feel energy rise
beneath her hands. Yelping in show she dropped the dagger back on the platter.
”It’s magic”
Granted that fact had been quite obvious but Felix’s shock had numbed
her thougths before she could process what exactly she was reacting to.
”Well how else do you expect to spar against magic wielders?”
Daen smirk grew and Felix sent him a confused look. She had sparred
against him, and needed no such gifts. While she detested the wooden training
blades at least that she understood.
”Oh relax, you’d think with all your grouching you’d be jumping at the
chance to finally stretch your legs and get stabby”
Cat rolled her eyes and leaned against the doorway.
”And you’re going to let me train with magic weapons? Thallan agreed to
this?”
Felix bit her tongue sharply at the last bit. The male’s name still felt odd
on her tongue spoken aloud. She had a hard time imagining Silver eyes agreeing
to being let outside her room, much less outside with pointy things.
Before Daen open his mouth in reply, a silk smooth cool voice oozed
from the shadows in the hall.
”Despite my best efforts, yes. Thallan ordered you to attend traning, and
insisted on you at least being able to defend yourself. Were it up to me you’d still
be bound to your bedframe.”

Ithira’s scowl was plenty enough to speak to her disagreement.
Eventhough her mate had long since forgiven Felix for the whole issue at the
slavers market, Felix had no such luck with the White Wolf.
”Amorei, we talked about this”
Catalyia gave Felix a small apologetic smile and shook her head at her
mate, to which Ithira only rolled her eyes. Daen not seeming to want to get
between the two bonded females, cleared his throat.
”Perhaps we should let Felix get suited up, and then we can leave, I have
men to train”
The room quickly dispersed after, and Felix released a breath upon her
renewed privacy. She lay the leathers and blades on the bed and began to unlace
her tunic. Gods what was she getting herself into?
***
The leathers were a Mother-sworn miracle, Felix was sure of it. For the
first time since the Autumnarian heir had stepped into the frozen court, her bones
didn’t quake with cold. Lined with fur and tightly packed to her form Felix could
feel over own heat reflected back at her despite the bitter chill. Even still she was
neither confined nor over-heated, somehow the leathers managed to keep her
regulated and she could move as if she wore nothing at all. Felix had always been
beholden to her leathers at home, they were her uniform, her shield before all the
prying eyes of her court, they were her distinction, she was a warrior, she was the
heir, not some prim maid fair. Yet here, she was matched her companions, both
Ithira and Cat wore similar leathers, the only distingusing feature was the ivory

189

wolf embroidered into Ithira’s back and paladins, and for Catalyia’s it was the
smallest bit of violent embroidery entertwined with the silver.
When Felix had stepped out of her chambers wearing her own leathers
none of her babysitters cast her much of a second glance. Daen had given her a
satisfied nod and a wink, as if to say ”now just stay out of trouble”. A ridiculous
sentiment coming from the male considering his normal habbits but Felix didn’t
comment. The trio not long after left the manner for a long trek towards yet
another towering mountain fortress.

baked into her skin for her entire life. The deep russet of her skin claimed as
much, as it shined from the sweat clinging to her hunched frame.
