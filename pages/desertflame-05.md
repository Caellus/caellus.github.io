What was it now? There wasn’t possibly a way her father could have heard news about the hunting party this quickly. . . she shook her head, well she’d have to find out. She gave a withering look to Hedion as he grinned at her smugly as if to say I told you so. 

Felix turned FireFly not before she felt her second reach for her grasping her elbow. She looked up staring into his amber gaze, the last rays of sun light shown on his concerned face as he spoke, 

“I know what you’re thinking, but Felix... just Don’t do anything rash.
Please.” 

Felix stared at him a second longer, searching his pleading gaze before wordlessly nodding. Allowing a slow breath to pass through her lips Felix arched
her neck preparing for the journey ahead. 

Even with her mount’s swiftness on the wind the journey would be at least a day. Turing away from the clean stalls Felix clicked Firefly forward. Soon the scent of smelting iron receded from Felix’s nostrils and was replaced first with fresh dew and golden fleck grasslands of her Court’s center and then the cool sea breeze, towards the palace . . . towards her father’s domain.
