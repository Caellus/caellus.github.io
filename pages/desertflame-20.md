but they danced normally as if taunting her failure. 

A thick fur rug covered the floor, and similar pelts hung on the walls, most of them seemed to be deer or perhaps elk. Then there was the rug. 

Black-stripes lined down the fur; it
was thick and white as frost. Felix had never encountered it’s like before. Though she supposed as she searched the rest of the room, perhaps her Father had simply hunted the beast out of existence in her own lands like anything else ancient or that stood a threat. 

Besides the visible signs of a hunter’s cabin, there was little to distinguish where she was.
There was a closed window on her right side, and she could just pick up the slightest sounds of the howling gusts from behind the thick glass. 

Felix shivered, back home she’d always enjoyed the wind, but here, she’d easily be
satisfied if she never had to witness another Winter breeze ever again. Winter.

The shock hit her in waves; the snow the ice, howling winds, Winterians, she was across the border. A week prior and Felix would be both panicked and thrilled to have been across the border; a week ago, she could have burnt all that was around her to ash. 

A week prior, and she would’ve claimed her glory and victory in her Father’s name. A week prior she would have still been Autumns
bright ember, it’s proud heir.

That was no longer the case now. Realizing to her dismay that she was stuck and unable to rectify it, the heaviness of grief, anger, and pain lulled her eyes shut and back into darkness. Sleep beckoned, and this time she had no qualms about listening.

“Wake Up”

The purr was faint, and the voice was feminine. Snide but still definitely
feminine. What sounded like great drums hammered into her temples as Felix
stirred.

“Common Fire Breather Get. Up.”

A small smile took over Felix’s face as she thought of their comment.

Did they think that was an insult? Hellae, if only they knew some of the things
Anollen would whisper and mutter about her every time he sewed her back
together. 

Though she supposed to her captors all Autmumnarians were all fire breathers The stranger evidently wasn’t amused by her smile. When she finally did open her eyes and adjust to the grey morning light, she found a short
violet-eyed female scowling at her. 

Mother’s Light, was it not possible for
Winterians to have ordinary eyes?

“No, some of us have perfectly dreary normal eyes like your green ones, but those born with Mother’s touch at birth are different.”

Felix gaped up until it dawned on her that she had spoken out loud. Color bloomed across her cheeks as the oddly tanned Winterian broke into a laugh.

“Y’know with all Ithira’s complaining about you, I’d thought you were either a bitch or just overly heavy, Not really sure what seemed to be the problem, you don’t seem that bad. . . a bit slow perhaps”

A smirk dotted the female's elegant features, and a quiet animalistic growl reverberated up Felix’s throat. “Icey Bitch,” she thought in her head as she wished her flames would melt her infuriating smile.

“Let me out of these binds, and I’ll show you just how slow I can be”

The female’s face instead of hardening or showing fear, broke out into an
even wider grin the promise of violence and perhaps even excitement danced in
her eyes.

“Oh, I see what the issue was now. . . I like you already. I'm sure you'll take to servitude just fine.”

The spritely ice bitch smiled. On any other occasion Felix would have retorted but instead her jaw hung slack, indignant. "What do you mean servitude?" 

The woman's smile only broadened, taking sheer enjoyment from Felix's protet. Felix shut her mouth and scanned the female before her. She was small in stature, but strong lean muscle covered her frame.

Even from her short distance away, Felix could tell she had enough strength that would no doubt be able to handle herself and possibly those double her size. Something almost resembling awe or respect flared begrudgingly in her.

Female warriors back home had been derived more from legend and myth else they were frowned upon or worse. Had she not been her father’s sole heir she would have been put to the correct path for women of her birth caliber; bastards had little all but one track, the one her mother always played.

“You’re a Deserter. Why else would a fire breather be doing on this side
of the Haize? And so as such, you will be taken to the servitude quarter and be assigned wherever’s needed. My guess, you’ll be a maid or perhaps a cook if you have any culinary skill,”

she gave Felix the once over. 

“Though I doubt it.”

Felix’s throat was dried and sounded like what could only be described as sandpaper.

“I am no Deserter.”

Felix felt her blood begin to thrum again; she’d rather be back in the irons of the Palace dungeons a prisoner than be labeled a coward a deserter. But then again Felix noted with sinking doubt what was she, a traitor, she had run.

“Then what are you, a princess? You sure as hell don’t look or smell like one,” 

The snort the Winterian finished with was as unladylike as anything Felix had ever heard.

No, not a princess, just the heir to their most hated rivaled court. For  the first time, Felix was almost glad she didn’t have her flames, they would have given her away. Her thoughts were abruptly interrupted by one sickening feeling: as she twisted beneath bonds and searched herself over as nausea rose up her throat.

“Where is my armor?”

Her leather guard had been the anchor for her flames, had been her sole keep from home before she ended up within this infernal winter. 

Ice bitch chuckled for a moment and shook her head like Felix had missed the punch line
of some obvious joke.

“I was wondering what a deserter was doing with such fine guard.
