fortress she’d more than likely freeze before she found some path back to her
freedom. So with no other remaining option the heir of the Autumnarian Court
glared at her captor and proceeded to sulk as he finally took off her bonds.

Chapter XVII
Felix
Holy mother in Light and Hell. Felix’s chest pounded louder than thnder
as she swiped rigt to dodge another incoming blow. Where Daen may have
lacked any seriousness in demeanor, he retained all of it in fight. Felix had never
come across someone so quick on their feet or so determined.
He didn’t fight like silver eyes, instead of a feline prowl and fighting
style, Daen was like that of the strongest tree and flexible with the wind and yet
when she managed to land a strike he was as unmoving as stone.
Daen had started initiating by baiting her.
”Let’s see what you’ve got Autumnarian”
Felix smiled, her blood hummed even without the help and guidance of
her flames. Before starting Daen had handed Felix a wooden practice sword,
when she’d raised a brow and lifted her nose to it Daen had chuckled.
”Trust me Sparky it will hurt a lot less when I hit you with this then if I
hit you with steel”
Having no other option she had relented and though she loathed to admit
it, Felix was glad she had. Felix was one of the best warriors within her court and
she could see from the sweat gathering on her opponent’s brow, he was
impressed but even then Felix couldn’t shake the feeling that she was again
perhaps outmatched.

After a few more bouts, which pitifully Felix won only a few Daen
motioned to lower her blade and fetched a water skin from his belt. When he
handed it to her Felix could’ve knelt onto the frigid stone and muttered a prayer
to the Goddess herself, she was parched.
”You have a finery with a blade, but you rush in too much. Your
determination and fierceness is your strength when you fihgt, you lose that when
you thrust in without thinking.”
Daen’s remarks pulled at her, she didn’t allow herself to say anything,
instead she allowed more cool blessed water to reach her throat.
”You also could do with some improvements to your endurance, while
you’re a wraith in a quick fight, should your opponent be able to fend you off
long enough, they can ware you down.”
Felix grunted.
”Why are you telling me this Winterian? What good does it do you
training an adversary?”
Felix’s emerald gaze met Daen’s and her captor seemed to pause for a
moment debating his next words carefully.
”Within this ring you are not my adversary, my opponent perhaps at times
but everything else remains outside. My queen asked and required that you
remain among us, train beside us. So that Felix is what we are going to do” He
again paused and this time offered her a hand up from her seated rest.
”Autumnarian or not, here you are one of us. Training is something that
does not discriminate. One should always be able to defend themselves”

Felix saw firm resolve within his gaze and a new heat and respect
bloomed as she gazed upon him. He was a warrior and he had recognized her the
same. Perhaps maybe, they could be simply that within the ring.
Felix didn’t bring herself to smile but she took his outstretched palm,
she’d try at least to do as he’d spoken and her shoulders in response felt just the
littest bit lighter.

Felix
Dusk had long since shrouded the training field in dim light by the time
Felix and Daen had finished their drills within the ring of stones.
Every inch of Felix ached in ways she hadn’t begun to think possible, her
very bones felt like wet sand and she longed to slump onto her soft bed, captured
or not she at this point cared little she just needed a bed.
At first Felix had dreaded asssuming they would have to make the long
artuous trek back to the Manor is the newly figid darkness but soon found her
worries laid to rest when Daen brought her to small cramped cabin barely enough
room for one, but there at least held a bed and small chest for her meager pouch
of belongings.
Before they had left on their journey here, Felix had been provided a
small set of provisions beyond the clothes on her back, a coat of warm fur from
some foliage habiatal creature clung around her shoulders and in her sac held a
spare set of clothes for the next day, a small canteen for which she had carried
water and a pair of oddly softened leather gloves that at first she had assumed
168

would tear at the first sign of use. However soon Felix relaized her gloves were
perhpas her most valuable possesion now, fore they had held in the warmth of her
body and dried any slick of sweat to keep her sword from slipping out of her
grasp. The gloves had also mercifully kept what likely would have been hellish
blisters from coating her palms and sore fingers.
Not long after settling in her small quarters and putting her training gear
asside a firm knock sounded on her door. Felix still found herself shocked that
she’d been allowed any semblance of privacy, then again she supposed Daen’s
warning still hung true, it wasn’t like there was anywhere she could go.
Felix answered the door peaking around the corner to find Daen calmly
leaning against the frame a wooden bowl of something steaming in his
outstretched hand.
”Eat up, today was a long one and you’re going to want your fill and then
rest before tommorrows dawn breaks”
At the mention of food Felix’s stomach growled and she quickly grabbed
the offering.
”Now, eventhough you didn’t try and run tonight I hope you’ll understand
why I’ll need to lock your door tonight. Can’t have you sneaking about, risking
