## Chapter VII
*Felix* 

Dark shimmering violet scales reflected her glow and shadows crawled
away from her light as she made out its enormous size. The ancient one was
magnificent. Her father had told her stories of the mighty Dragon that ruled her
lands long before the ancient faerie lords. The Dragon were the monsters that
held the most primal powers, the barest and strongest of Nature’s power. Before
her stood an Ancient, A Dragon. One of Limeare’s firstborn.
A scream of terror pushed up her throat but she clamped her jaw tight to
stop it. Her knees trembled and she struggled to keep the foolishly brave mask on her features.

“Now you see me faerie you know, what I am. you now understand I am
something to fear. you dare threaten me with the power my brethren gave to your
ancestors centuries ago? the flames do not belong to you. Faerie proved
honorable and true but since we gave them power they have grown corrupt and
cruel. you nor your kind deserve the power flowing through your lifeblood. you
must earn the power you hold so dearly”

A new scream burst from her lips. Blistering flames ignited every cell in
her body. It was as if the beast was tearing apart her body slowly ripping through her. Like it was shredding her very soul. Any agony she felt before intensified.

Death would have been mercy. Tears traced down her cheeks Bile and vomit
chased up her throat and a terrible chill invoked her.

“W-what have you done?”

Her flames burned her palms and guttered quickly. A clawing empty
feeling raked at her chest and her back wound stung and ached a new.

“You may be a dragon scale but you have lost the truth of your ancestors.
you, faerie will learn the price to power, I have taken what my brethren gave your bloodline. Without your fire, you will learn the consequences, your father and his kind have wrought on this world”

She felt bare, weak, vulnerable and alone. It was gone. All of it was gone.

“Please” the words died on her lips. Terrible cold-like none she’d ever
experienced hissed against her torn flesh. Though it was silent she knew the beast was still there. Its eyes still gazing down onto her. Hatred flowed through her as she again stared into the blackness.

“You won’t kill me yet you take the one sole piece of me I have left”

Her voice was below a whisper but she knew it could hear her.

“Faerie if that power is all that you are. then you are not yet ready nor
strong enough to have it.”

The beast’s voice was quieter this time and all condescension and anger
were gone. Instead, there were only notes of varying sorrow.
Felix felt as if all her flame had been doused. Her body now only
thrummed with flagging exhaustion. Her knees gave out and once again she fell
to the gravel beneath. Her breaths turned slow and she could feel death’s grip
tightening yet she knew she wouldn’t fully succumb after all now was not her
time according to the ancient.

Slowly Felix closer her eyes and let the heaviness in every inch of her
body take control. Just before sleep fully engulfed her Felix heard one final
whisper.

“Mother of light, air, and flame, of earth and water and ice. Mother of the
eternal balance. please hear me now. She is ready now, take her to where she will be safe. She must learn to survive, she must heal”

If she’d had the strength Felix would’ve told the beast it was no use.
She was a traitor to Autumn and the Empire there was no place where she
would ever be safe now. Her eyes shut once again but for a fleeting second, there was brilliant flash and then finally painless oblivion.
