### Writing 

I am a writer, and by that I mean not a whole lot more than the literal definition. That said though I love working on my bits of stories, various plots and tons of characters.

As of right now I am keeping my novels more private as I continue to work on them but here I can talk about my writing process as well as some resources I use.

As of right now I am currently working on one of two novels. 

- A Deserter's Flame 
- The Four Who Brought it all Down 

#### Resources: 

Here is a great [character name generator](https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com)
Their site is also really great for really any names, as well s writing guides etc. 

For less fantasy esc stuff here's a good [real name generator](https://www.namegenerator.biz/last-name-generator.php)

Good in-depth [character sheet](http://www.epiguide.com/ep101/writing/charchart.html)
