I am a writer, and by that I mean not a whole lot more than the literal definition. That said though I love working on my bits of stories, various plots and tons of characters.

As of right now I am keeping my novels more private as I continue to work on them but here I can upload new projects, character names and ideas etc.

As of right now I am currently working on one of two novels. 

- A Deserter's Flame 
- The Four Who Brought it all Down
