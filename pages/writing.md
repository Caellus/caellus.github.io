### Writing 

I am a writer, and by that I mean not a whole lot more than the literal definition. That said though I love working on my bits of stories, various plots and tons of characters.

As of right now I am keeping my novels more private as I continue to work on them but here I can talk about my writing process as well as some resources I use.

As of right now I am currently working on one of two novels. 

- A Deserter's Flame 
- The Four Who Brought it all Down 

#### Process: 

In terms of how I write, it really is somewhat of an unplanned mess XD 

*Plot* 

For my first novel I ever tried which I finished in middle school (The Four Who Brough it all down is its current revision) I started first by gleaming an idea for plot, either from imagining the world setting, in this case a dystopian future, or by using other stories I liked as a guide. 

Some of it too depends on what sort of novels you like to read and or want to write about, for me I love fantasy and dystopian fiction, those two areas for me light up something in me and I feel most absorbed in those types of worlds. 

*Characters*

Once I settled on a plot, in this case a shady dystopian government kidnapping specific individuals with a higher chance of a key mutation, (yes very x-men I know). So then once I had a base idea it was time to make characters. 


Initially I started by first sitting down at an avatar creator, one of many you can find online and one I created faces that felt right names began popping up in my head. 

For me I am pretty lucky that once names come, I usually have this odd sense of the person in my head, but if I still feel blocked I use the character guide I linked below to help me further refine them. 

With my first novel once I had the character names and faces, their dynamics just started to make sense, I paired names together and even made maps for how they're relate to one another. Who would love eachother, who would despise each other etc. I find mapping out character dynamics really helpful because it helps promote backstory, why they feel that way and it also usually causes fun scenes to start popping into my head. 

*Actually Writing* 

So this is the step I struggle with the most which I think is common and the blank page can be daunting. 

With my first novel, what I did was I actaully wrote the last page first especially since I had planned a cliffhanger so I had fun writing out all the excitement and then once I finsihed the last page, then I wrote the first. 

This isn't how I decided to try writing my second novel, but it still did help because it gave me end points and then all I had to do was connect them, which can seem easier than just writing with no physical end in sight. 

Other than all of that, I generally just try and continue the rough idea of events I have in my head and then also add any occasional scenes that just pop in my head.
