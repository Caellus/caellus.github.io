magic who managed to escape execution were burned below the skin with
enough heat so that all traces of ice and frost melted and their magic along with
it. Felix stared. A palace slave, a saved magic-user; Mother’s Light must’ve
taken pity on the girl, she was lucky to be where she was. Felix took thinly sliced
cheese, still eyeing the submissive slave before her.
“Hurry with that food girl, or I will have your watcher informed of your
incompetence.”
Her mother’s vile tongue lashed at the girl, and Felix almost felt a twang
of sympathy.
The slave’s shoulders tensed, and she moved even faster to spread the
food out along the long table. She drew nearer, and Felix could just make out her
bright blue-turquoise eyes that clashed with the blood-red curve of the
Autumnarian brand tattooed beside her right eye.
Every slave was given the brand to show them who they belonged too. It
was cruel, unnecessary in Felix’s mind. She’d never had the stomach for such
things, but her Father had made it law since his days fighting on Vaelan so she

43

supposed he’d know best what was deserved.
Oddly enough, the girl’s eyes showed something different than the rest of
her body language. They were sharp and bright, not dim like many other smarter
servants. Pride.
Felix almost choked a laugh. Her eyes showed pride, even the smallest bit
of defiance. The girl had the audacity to believe she was better than her status.
She followed orders, but she had the nerve to show distaste for serving them.
Even though she was reduced to powerlessness and a collar remained bound
around her throat and scars of enslavement etched upon her hands, she still had
the foolishness or maybe the courage enough to show some semblance of
discontentment. The girl was an idiot; if either her mother or father saw the
determined look in her eyes, they’d drag her back to her overseer and likely deal
out the appropriate punishment for her insolence.
Felix had no love for the slavery in her nation, but she respected the
hierarchy; it was a way of life. Those who could wield power over those who
couldn’t. It was simple.
“Do you need anything, my lady.”
Her voice was soft but not gentle the underlying harshness and the anger
freezing the girl’s insides could be heard in her whisper. The title was not of
respect, but of mockery. Felix met the girl’s stare with one of her own.
“Teach her a lesson. Teach her who she bows to. Let me show all of
them.”
The whispers pulled at her insides. The smooth silver-tongued voice in
44

her ear demanding bloodshed that some part of her craved, but she hung back.
The girl was a fool, but she was young, and Felix did not wish to spill more
Winterian blood today.
“You will respect my home. Slave. You and your people are lucky
enough to have a roof over your heads and food to eat. Be grateful and think
again about your tone with me.”
The girl seemed to freeze; a doe caught staring down the shaft of a
hunter’s arrow. Her pale skin lost further color, and fear shifted in her blue irises.
But then like switch something harder peaked in her eyes, anger or resentment
Felix couldn’t tell.
The girl’s hand rose, and for a minute, it almost seemed like all cold air in
the room was drawn to her palm, but then in a flash it was gone. The spark
behind her irises remained but, its light diminished. As if remembering her place,
she took a step back, straightened her posture, and walked away to attend to the
next guest.
“That’s right little Winterian walk away. You and your magic are nothing
here.”
Felix bit into her cheek and made to get up and excuse herself from the
remainder of the meal. She was going to lose her control soon if she wasn’t
careful. She rose slowly when the dining room doors slammed open. The loud
crash silenced everyond at the table.
A breathless, haggard messenger came shooting into the room. His eyes,
wide, hard with panic. He reminded Felix of a rabbit caught in a snare during one

45

of her hunts. He gasped for air and practically fell at Lord Thiradin’s feet.
The messenger’s uniform was drenched in sweat. He seemed parched. He
opened his mouth, but for a moment, no words spilled out. He met Felix’s gaze
as if she could give him the words he was looking for. Something was wrong.
Very very wrong.
“What is it, boy?” Her father looked down at his herald expectantly.
“Someone get the lad some water.”
Felix crouched beside the young man and put a hand on his back, trying
to reassure his heaving lungs that they would again get the air they needed.
“Breathe, in and out and then tell us what’s the matter” her voice was
calm just above a whisper.
The man’s frantic eyes met hers, and the absolute warning she got from
his stare was enough to shake her to her core.
“Everyone out Now. Dinner is over dismiss yourselves accordingly.”
No one dared defy her command, whether she had the actual authority to
clear the room no one dared question. If not for the dire look in the man’s eyes,
Felix would have laughed at the Court’s nobility hustling to leave the room, tails
between their legs.
A servant from the kitchens rushed in with a flask of water. The man
shakily rose his hand for the flask, and when he let the cool liquid reach his
inflamed throat, he let out a small moan of appreciation. The suspense reached
its peak, impatience was going to rip her father to pieces.

“Well, spit it out, boy! Why did you interrupt my dinner?”
The messenger boy coughed and sputtered but quickly got ahold of
himself.
“Sire, she’s called the council. . . all of the High Courts have been
summoned. All are to meet at Aaphire. The Winterians . . . they’ve amassed.
