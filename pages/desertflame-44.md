title: Deserters Flame

Well that and the late Faerie unfortunate enough to incure her wrath. Felix’s second in command, the halfbreed Rider of Autumn stood almost awkwardly at her silence. Hedion Amnes, the halfbreed who’d risen through the
ranks. 

Even from her place in the palace and kitchens Cil knew the stories of the Bastard and Halfbreed who together flipped the ranks of Autumn’s warriors rising to become perhaps the most sucessful pairing since Lord Thiradin and
Gabrielle in the Great War.

Rumor had spead of the second in command’s thorough search for his first, and his determination in bringing her home. He had likely scouted much of the surrounding land and nearby villages for any sign of her. 

Though many had been sure by now he’d give up. Ciliren wondered at the male’s intentions, afterall he’d further risen in station. Perhpas he merely meant to solidify his standing by bringing the escaped deserter back in chains. 

Light knew men always seemed to seek whatever could bring them more power no matter whatever cost or loyalties they may have once held. Old wounds brushed the back of Ciliren’s mind at the thought and she had to bite hard into the corner of her cheek to distract from letting them take hold.

"Ciliren then, were you here that night, when this all happened”

He gave a mild gesture to the vast destruction. Cil gave a nod, not
bothering to speak, her curiousity continuing to grow.

”I know the rumors and have heard the reports from guards, might I hear it from someone unbiased, what happened here that night”

His gaze watched her carefully, honest curousity and weariness met hers, she noticed then, despite the Commander’s alert stance exhaustion weighed him.

”I was not in the room m’lo- Commander. I could only hear the shouting and feel the great heat. Later I only saw the guard rush to the Lord and, the heir, they took her in chains.”

Hedion nodded in thought, her story likely matched the dozens of others he’d heard whispered. It had been months since the burning, surely Hedion knew it by now, knew the blame lay at the hands of his first. Even the most fervent had ceased their questioning weeks ago.

”I see, my apolgies. Many have likely questioned all from that night. But I know Felix was no traitor-”

The last words seemed almost like a whisper to himself. Hedion looked away from her and gazed back at their surroudings, she could almost see past his well-held mask to the dip of concern and sorrow brewing there. Such words even said to a slave were dangerous to utter ar a time like this when defending a deserter.

There was little doubt, Hedion Amnes was a strange male.

Just before the male turned to leave the room and allow Cil to return to her monatinous scrubbing, more rushed footsteps echoed in the hall. A guard clad in proper Autumnarian uniform rushed in, his cape billowing behind him.

”Commander, you’ve been summoned to the High Lord’s chambers imediately... the Lord, he’s awake”.

*Felix* 

Felix had been right. It seemed no matter what hour the male managed to meander off to bed, or finish with his galavanting Daen was merciless when it came to morning waking. Felix had managed just a few short hours of blistful sleep before the feathered projectile had slammed into her face. The pillow was
soft thank the light, but her swift awakening had not been well recieved. Felix hoped the punch she’d returned to his shoulder bruised for a long while as a reminder of her displeasure. unfortunately the male still had insisted she rise.

Light bright and clear swathed through kitchen and dining hall windows as Felix wandered out of her room, sweet smells of tea, bread, rolls and jams reached her nose and her stomach lurched ready to devour the waiting breakfast.
At least in the Manor Daen would allow her to eat before whatever lasted scheme he had in mind, in the barracks it had been traning for hours before her first taste of anything beyond her own sweat.

”Good Morning Sparky”

Catalyia swayed into the room bright and smiling, her normal leathers set firmly in place, Felix noted the daggers strapped at her sides and the bracers
clasped at her forearms. Felix gave a small wave in answer not bothering to wake her vocal cords just yet. She needed brew first, the dark bitter drink called out to
her, it was too damn early. Felix didn’t care for the thought that hit her, she’d grown weak in her time away, back in her camp she’d risen rested at dawn’s light and trained till dusk, Mother Light she needed to get back home. 

Felix tried to placate her thougths on the fact that back home, she hadn’t had a galavanting half-druken babysitter to keep her up at all hours.

Speak of the devil, Daen wandered in after the short female, a grin still plastered onto his face when he noted Felix’s scowl.

”Aww Cat, I think she missed us”

The two fuckers, grinned at each other as Felix finally began the process of peeling herself from her sheets. Niether of them even remotely looked tired, gods.

"What do you want?”

Felix eyed them both wearily. Catalyia merely shrugged, and Daen lifted his fingers to his lips before a quick shrill whistle left his lips. As his arms dropped,  a light swish prickled in Felix’s ears as some unseen servant
strolled forward, the only sign that anything approached was the light breeze of movement and the floating tray coming towards her. Upon a silver tray wasn’t the heaps of food her stomach longer for her to devour but something that caused small tingles to shoot down her spine. 

Folded artfully against the gleaming platter lay some of the most beautiful fighting leathers Felix had ever seen. Fine
filigree and silver threads delicately embroidered smooth thick leather that resembled the dark bark of the beautiful pines encompassing the court around her. 

The leathers reminded her of those she had worn in her own camps but where hers had been gold laced and closer to the color of burnt embers these resembled sleek stone, black with the hint of silver, like small bits of frost
shining against a night sky. But perhaps what stole her breath even more than the leathers were the pair of glinting crescent daggers.
