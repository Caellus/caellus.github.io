title: Deserters Flame

and the many many blacksmiths and barracks. Each hanging their stamp of the
two crossed wyverns: The High Lord’s Crest. A smile twitched her lips as she
walked towards her beloved home. Smoke and ash welcomed her further, like an
old friend’s embrace.
Felix’s village Meurhaven, was the last settlement near the cold northern
border of Winter. Because of their close proximity, it wasn’t unusual for there to
be hostility, usually it was regarding deserters. That said, Felix had an odd knack
to continually undermine and pick useless conflicts with their walled-off
neighbors. It wasn’t like her fights were totally unprovoked. . . well, at least most
of the time, they weren’t. Either way the Winterians had it coming.
Though the Haize blocked most communication, every now and again bits
would falter and Felix would get her match with the frosty Border Guard. They
were bastards, arrogant and cold. Winterian fairies. They at times even leveled
her own ability in combat, and on the rare occasion she did cross them they never
let her forget it. In her latest conquest, Felix . . . may have possibly lit a small
flame to their northwestern watchtower. In her defense they had been rearing for
a fight, and she answered in kind. They paid her by leaving a nasty bite of frost to
scar her left cheek and, of course, the lovely gash marring her back.

Felix shook off memories of her run in at the border and trudged through
the blooming orange camp. She could smell the fires from miles away. Ash,
wood, and iron. While other courts may have held the endurance of life and earth
or the smooth grace of water or even mystery of frost, her people held the best
essence. They were the people of the dancing flame and the strength of molten
iron and steel. Faeries born unto the flame.
The forge was the Autumnarian pride. Blacksmith stalls lined every
corner carrying with them the scent of heat, sweat, and the tang of the craft. Bits
and bobs hung in each shop, precious metals, plates of armor, gauntlets, and then
her favorite, lethal blades all reflected the sun’s brilliant gaze. Fire twinkled in
each, and Felix felt the twinge of familiarity in the flames. Each like a calling,
sending her warmth and guidance. Like bound to Like. Felix thrived in the
flames just as her Father before her. Fire danced under her skin.
Felix continued down into the village’s heart content to let her mind loose
itself in her thoughts. The calm but ever-bustling village out her mind and soul at
ease, the controlled thrum and chaos of a military border camp, it was exactly
where she belonged.
”Commander”
Felix stopped in her tracks and turned. The familiar male voice trickled
into her sensitive ears and set a smile to her lips. Felix watched as her second
quickly marched towards her. Hedion Amnes had well over five inches on Felix.
He was a well-trained adversary at times, strong and impressive, to any other
these were the Lieutenant’s defining traits. Yet as Hedion’s frame neared her,
something else swelled in Felix’s chest while her second came closer.

Clad in his leather armor Felix’s stare traced down the male’s form first
checking for signs of distress or injury then noting the silvery slick liquid,
ghoul’s blood spilled across his chest. He had been out hunting again. Hedion’s
face was almost ashen grey from soot, but otherwise, he seemed unharmed. Even
his features lit with a small smirk. Felix found his amber gaze and gave him a
small smile. Warmth beyond that of her magic, filled her veins from his gaze.
Even just for a minute, Felix could almost see the deeply veiled desire that
always seemed to wait and burn for her. Hedion didn’t offer an embrace other
than grasping her forearm and offering his salute, offering two fingers to his
collarbone. He never was quite able to fully step outside of ranks and what was
expected. Even when he knew she wished he would. Instead, Hedion remained
always the perfect soldier. Not allowing her tumultuous emotions to show Felix
continued to gaze and lifted an eyebrow,
”Yes, Lieutenant?”
For a moment, he said nothing. But, he looked like something was on the
tip of his tongue, something he knew she wouldn’t like. A small delicate crease
lined between his two caramel brows. She stopped, crossed her arms, and lifted a
brow.
”Well?”
Hedion stared straight into her face this time. He had a perfect mask
almost as if he’d been carved by Light herself from granite. His eyes stared into
hers, gaging her possible reactions, and determining how far away he needed to
get to be a safe distance when he told her whatever he was trying to hide. She
both valued his incessant shrewdness and perceptive nature but also found it
13

incredibly annoying.
”Hedion Spit It Out”
With a sigh, Hedion looked away from her eyes and instead looked at the
trampled path beneath their feet.
”Commander . . . while you were detained in the healer’s tent, your father
launched the Hunt . . . He ordered you to stay behind. His orders were after the
Hunt you come to the palace; it seems your Mother is looking to get you into
trouble again.”
Hedion was right; she didn’t like what he had to say. Her Father had
launched the Hunt without her! What was he thinking? Ordering her to stay
behind was foolish, she knew the Northern Border and the Dark Wood better
than anyone, she lived on the outskirts of the Court for a reason. ”Who is leading
the Hunt then?” she ground out through clenched teeth. Her heart pounded in her
ears as her anger rose.
Hedion crossed his arms, and his stone-cold expression turned to a
disgusted scowl.
”Lord Davern of East Mount has been bestowed that honor.”
Her honor. The little red anger burning inside her boomed. Davern was
an imbecile! Pompous overweight, he wouldn’t know the difference between a
doe’s tracks and a wolf’s even if the snarling beast spat in his face. What in
Hellae had possessed her father to pick such a lumped ass for lead Hunter?
”Felix? Your Father ordered you to stay behind. Bee-hind it means you
don’t follow. It’s my responsibility to make sure you stay put and let them catch


their Hunt.”
She flipped to face him, her eyes wide and incredulous.
