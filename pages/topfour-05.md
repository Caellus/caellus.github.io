*PARIS - Present*  

Cold and unpleasant. Those were first thoughts that soaked through the haze were cold and unpleasant. Drumming aches rattled across my spine and neck. My shoulders groaned stiff, as I slowly adjusted. Whatever exercise Gisella had had me do, I clearly hadn’t warmed up correctly. I would need to bark at that women for putting me so thoroughly on my ass. 

Slowly I shifted and tried to move my arms up to massage my sore joints when I registered the clink and cool feeling of metal licking into my skin. The wave hit then, compounding memories and images, getting home, the fight, the invaders, Mum. Mum! 

My eyes flew open bleary and unfocused as my chest squeezed, air suddenly wouldn’t come, Mum, she was shot. Had they called an a medic? Would anyone find her? I tugged forward, twisting my body, realizing that my hands and arms were secured above my head. Cold raked through my spine as I searched around me still feeling an unseen fog over my senses. Above me shined a bright blinding light, it was too white, too cold. Unnatural stillness creeped over every sensitive nerve, the room was barren for all save but a small table to my left and a door. And then squinting through the glinting light my eyes make out a mirror. Unease pooled at the base of my spine. 

“Hello?” 

My voice comes out coarse, dry and raspy, sand paper lines my throat an in that moment I wish more than anything for a glass of water. Everything around me remained motionless, but the prickling feeling of someone’s eyes on me doesn’t alleviate. I can’t see them but it is almost like I can feel them, something else too, something sharp almost an invisible pulse against my body. It felt wrong. 
After blinking a few more times I start to notice everything is in complete focus. Wrong. All of it was wrong.
