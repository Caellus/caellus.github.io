“You dare cross our borders and make demands of us? You are far far from home Autumnarian.”

A second high male replied hotly. The crowd before her reacted in shocked whispers,if they hadn’t linked her by her hair or complexion, there was now no confuaion to which court she belonged. Animosity swarmed across her skin with all the stares.

“I will demand and do what is necessary to gain back what was mine before you, and your ilk chained me like a dog for your barbaric show.”

Magic strong and bitter to her tongue flooded the air and her senses. It seemed they did not take kindly to her threats. Felix again dug for her flames only to find nothing. Even as fear clanged inside of her as bitter magic swelled in the air, her face remained stoic and undeterred.

“Won in a fair fight? I didn’t realize our neighboring Court kept female fighters”

Goose-flesh broke out along Felix’s spine, and she cursed while also silently thanking Hellae and Light both that she didn’t follow her Father’s request and wear her more Court appropriate garb. Regardless of her situation, she could not under any circumstances let any of them find out who she truly was. An heir
to their strongest rival was too valuable.

“I am border guard from one of the outlying villages, and as you can see, I can fight fine regardless of my sex.”

The sarcastic male from before smirked down at her.

“It appears so, although are we only to take your word that you defeated our friend in a truly fair match?”

Felix clenched her teeth hard enough; she could feel the remnants of her healing jaw groan.

“If you don’t take me at my word Winterian come down from there, and I’ll happily face you to prove it; in return, you’ll release me.”

The crowd facing her murmured in surprise, but her eyes only watched the dais.

Just as the smart-mouthed male moved to join her, a hand came out in front to block him. Felix’s gaze shifted to the third male; he was the only one who hadn’t spoken. He wasn’t looking at her. Instead, he stared at his friend, commencing some sort of silent back and forth. After a few short moments of
deliberation, the eager male bowed his head, and to her disappointment, the silent
one gracefully jumped down and prowled towards her.

He stood tall she barely stood above his shoulder, and around her magic thrummed pulsing against her skin, the bitter taste in her mouth increased. His broad frame should’ve slowed him and yet the Faerie before her moved with no thought.He was entirely at ease. 

Everything in how he moved to how he stared down at her, every bit the High Fae Male.

His eyes were cold, and his face was that of stone, reminding Felix of the statues her mother placed in palace gardens all except for the slight razor sharp smirk that tilted from the corner of his lips. His eyes: sharp silver that sent chills down her spine. Goddess and Mother Light it was like looking straight into the purest moonlight.

Up close, he was beautiful, breathtakingly beautiful as if he were carved by Mother Light herself if for nothing else then just to taunt Felix and make her forget herself.

His hair; dark and brushed across his brow, the rest cut finely to his head. Not a piece out of place. As he edged closer Felix thought she might have caught the faintest glimpse of Winterian’s legendary ink peaking from under the High Faerie’s tunic. It’s enthralling white like frost. The ink faintly seemed to glow about him. The thing of legends. The Fae before her was every bit of the mythic
warrior who could tame a killing fields of hundreds. 

Every bit the High Fae who’s ancestors had once conquered the world and slaughtered all who stood before them. Felix felt herself shiver, whether in delight or unease she couldn’t tell, whichever it was, what was to come would be something she would not
forget. 

As the formidable male bowed to her once in what she was sure only to be mock respect. She bit her lip, and once being sure he took her challenge seriously, she released her hostage. The short female spun around in a flash and
growled but kept her distance. Felix grinned and winked at violet eyes.

Soon, she would be free of all of them. Soon. As soon as she finished
putting this arrogant High-Born male on his ass.

“You put forth your challenge. A fair match, you win you go free.”

His voice was quiet but sharp, like a concealed blade; and suddenly she remembered that voice. Felix’s eyes narrowed, and her muscles drew stiff a growl curling at the back of her throat. She knew that voice. He was there when they’d taken her from the borders. 

She remembered the last time she’d heard this
male; he’d been bored then. Taking in a breath, Felix felt herself match his smirk
with her own. He wouldn’t be bored now.

“And what if I lose Winterian, what will you do with me then?”

His smirk sharpened almost a sneer, and for a second, his eyes almost seemed to gleam before he returned to stone.

“Should you lose, depending on your actual ability, you will be put in a
noble house or taken to the barracks at least until the Queen fully sees to your
sentencing Autumnarian.”

He all but spat out the last part. The room was silent, and the magic in the air felt like it was going to burn against her skin. If her audience hadn’t fully grasped her race before, they certainly had now.

“No tricks, none of your . . . magic."

Felix warned and cursed inside that her voice had loss some of its bite. She couldn’t name it; she’d fought powerful males all her life, but this one, he put her one edge and made her teeth grind.

After his second of hesitation, he nodded, the thrumming disappeared, and the bitter taste dissolved receding back into whatever dark delves he retrieved it from.
As soon as it was gone, Felix pounced.
